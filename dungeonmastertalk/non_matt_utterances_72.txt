He literally marked them off.


It's quaint and rustic, shut up.


Was that the Sun Tree?


Okay, let's manacle it. Let's at least try to hold it.


I'll work on the legs if you work on the hands.


I heard serpent and leviathan. Is leviathan a giant squid?


Oh, can I cast Locate Object and try to find that diamond that he chucked over the side?


Higher than ten.


Oh, that's even better. 33.


We do. It's 4 00 in the afternoon.


He was waiting.


Horris, we obviously have a lot to decide on. Perhaps it would be better if you stayed up in the room.


Okay, so we know better. We know you don't have to cast it.


I just want something in return. You know, you provide a service, get something in return, right?


Yeah, it's fire.


I am waiting behind, motherfucker!


But it's one of my most powerful spells, you guys, so if we're going to fight somebody, I don't know if it's smart.


Performance?


Was the light seen by the arrow?


I'm going to do it once we're out. We're just going to go.


Come on, secret Santa.


I go walking down the hallway, this way.


So we're gonna go this way.


Fuck, I'm dead.


Also the three figures on each wall, are they standard humanoid form?


So we will join together.


Was it bad?


I don't like guns.


I never stopped digging, can I assume that everybody's buried?


Bring it on.


Who moved? Oh, the stones moved?


Flurry of blows.


What?! You have so many cloaks, though. Why do you need another one?


Yeah, let's get going.


You're not my type.


Oh, it is a new day.


They won't see him maybe they won't--


Royalty's a strong word.


I think I have two left.


I'm going to cast Locate-- oh, should I do that? Should I waste it right now?


Halas?


Me and doors don't get along too well.


Frenzied does-- Yes.


Yeah. Get down off the pedestal, I guess. Literally back to back with him, shoulder blades against shoulder blades, and hold her attack in case she-bitch shows up.


Let's carb up.


I used to be able to, but I--


Filled with pickled ears!


Jackpot.


I love this because it's kind of like an aerator.


Have they seen me yet?


Yeah, we had a whole little thing, it was really nice.


Aw, I rolled a one. Plus two, plus four. Six damage.


"Where is Harvey Dent?" (high-pitched squealing)


I know, I know, I know. Can I stealth forward?


Demistrik, show them out.


(like an air horn) Dungeons & Dragons!


Please tell me they stole the giant painting.


We got so much bling. We're stupid rich.


Sure, but this is our MO.


12 plus strength, which is low, is 14. The dragon sword-- is the dragon sword plus anything, guys? I don't know that I have the--


Double crits, oh.


I said it in an accent.


Come on, everyone has Control Water, don't they? I've got it.


Of course. How could I forget? (laughter)


Hit him. Hit him!


Also, I am not always wearing the Raven Queen's armor. I'm wearing some of Percival's loaner cast-of-Hamilton clothing right now. I, on the break, built a trapped box to slide under the bed so that I can let my skin breathe at night.


Yeah, this clusterfuck's not over.


So question, do we crash here for the night or do we make it back to the (hiccup) castle?


That is a 17.


Is Sanctuary still on her?


Right!


So I'm going next to the red guy.


Athletics, you said? Seven.


A lot of butts.


We can tell what my place in the party is.


Well no, I don't see a lot of Giant, just even Common or--


Don't worry. I'm using the flat end. Oh, good. That's a 17.


I really think we should stay down here with it.


Okay, so we got two kills, four maybes.


No, this is the one that--


Do you remember when we psyched out the duergar--


I can ask him! Yeah!


How much debt are we talking?


We'll have a room by ourselves.


Using Scanlan's advantage, so 16, 29. (sighs)


Sure. Yeah, I'm going for its head.


Oh thank you. It makes me feel so much better.


They're tough.


I think he would prefer a real hand than a claw hand.


I Fonzie'd it.


Oh, I'm not eating.


So should we just try to get rid of everything right now, then, as it were?


Oh shit! Shit!


Oh man! We're taking a whole week off from this.


Toward-- never mind.


No, this is the Fire Ashari's camp.


Oh I'm proficient at persuasion. Wow, who knew?


Wrong die, I was doing my melee attack. First one. Okay. Seven damage. Second one: five damage.


Zero, for religion.


Hey, Pike. Do you want to take Percy's temperature?


We did okay.


I take a greater healing potion. Can I reach Vax at all? Can I find any part of his foot or anything and pull him down to me?


Betrayal.


But there's things that were crawling around amongst the dead.


Bare ass. Bare ass I get it really good, like (whack)!


I'm going to head that way.


That's what I'm saying. Let's see what we're up against. Let's take a breather and let's go pick one off.


I roll this?


You mean like as a human? Or would they know me as a me?


So I've just been sitting here watching this, shocked?


Plus we can provide several chains. Once it's on the ground, maybe your very strong goliaths could try to snare it, grappling-hook it, throw some chains up and over?


Quickly, please, someone come up with an argument that counteracts that.


North is--


Sister's good for an escape route.


Yeah, let's see if this hits. 17?


That's a crit! That's a critical roll?


Vanessa, I have a question. What happens if we don't come back with all of the members we left with?


Oh no. And you're doing it as Tary?


We didn't print this out yet.


What's up, brother?


Okay. (clanging sound effects)


Okay. Wait, I cut out right when you said, was that guy bad?


Sure, yeah!


Who were they targeting?


You and me, goblina.


We should hide.


From @millena, let us know about your Etsy.


Let's just talk aesthetics, because once you get into it, then you get to know the person.


I thought a meager amount. 50,000 gold.


Maybe we should just calm down and go to sleep.


With the trees, we will know how to return quickly with a force.


Way less!


11 for Fjord.


It was a real Heisman trophy. (laughter)


Too specific.


Pike, which one of those two is Vax's? Which one of those two belongs to Vax?


Should we leave a couple outside or anything or no?


Apocalypse Now.


I don't know if I can be grappled. We can Dimension Door, though, I can try and take you--


Do you actually have a map that we could use? Borrow?


What? I mean if you're pursuing like, a flowery lady--


Have we been there yet?


Someone did actually do that. That was really weird.


No, you burned your lower-level spells.


Well, let's at least go home for now. Is that okay? Is that enough for now?


Of the brain.


You know, I don't know. I never thought to ask.


I mean, if you can push yourself to go to the Nine Hells, you can go out to a tavern with us and meet people.


Don't do it.


Well, one and a half of them.


I am joining you for this ridiculous tea party.


No new exotics came in?


Is that the bad one?


Hits? Okay, good.


(singing) And all I want from you is a promise you will kiss me forever.


Just rub poo all over it?


I prepped acid on this thing and I missed bad. I got a total of nine, so that did not hit.


Oh. Okay. I hope everyone's okay. Please, Traveler, be with them. I'm going to start running towards the docks in disguise.


I feel great!


You've had your Creole.


I point at the table and I say  reach into the shadow and see if you can take the skull.


Why are you having trouble picking that up?


This is so uncomfortable.


Should we call back?


Get him on a boat. Get on a boat, Tary.


Just out of idle curiosity--


That's dark.


Not attunable. (louder excited gasps)


I'm not looking at your notes, I'm just looking through the wall.


My dagger hand's the one that's out. I want to try to maneuver the sword around and stab inward and keep cutting bacon in here. I want to attack the dragon, but still from the inside with the hand that's inside.


-- a bitch?


No, I don't suggest that, Grog. I shoot firebolt.


Fine, do you want to know what it does?


Was it nighttime or daytime?


You're looking for a sign?


All right. I'll give it a go.


They stole his Emmy?


Short rest.


That we don't know what it is.


Sotto  I was debating heavily in watching Avantika to see if, with a distraction of trying to board the pirate ship today, that I can maybe sneak into her office with the distraction. But I noticed she was very adamant holding back and watching the entire scenery. It was not safe to go into her quarters. If we need to get into her office, I think it's going to have to be an important enough and big enough distraction.


Um... (nervous laugh)


And maybe an antacid. I don't know, maybe that'll help with the laugh. [laughter]


Can we infuse a Fog spell with a Sleep spell?


It feels like everything is being sucked to this location.


That's actually a very good point.


A very long time. If I start it right now..


She's related to Percy? I don't see the resemblance.


Yes! Okay. Good.


But we also know that Raishan knows everything that we're going to do.


That we do not have our healer, at present.


We are not even slaves. We are consumables.


Okay, no narwhals.


Yeah. Keep going. Looks good.


If I can't make a DC of 10, I don't know.


No, Balgus! Fuck! Trinket, come here! Are we allowed to cuss? Trinket, come here!


I pull it back. I stick the point in between his ribcage, and I drive it up through him. (shocked noises)


Although I appreciate her guns and her biceps.


I've actually already packed; I'll go get my things.


I run over to Grog. I'm still an elemental, yeah? I am still an elemental. Where is he?


Just a weekend trip.


It's this, okay.


I reach through, and if I can grab Grog, I cast Hold Person on him.


Maybe we should make sure there's, like, fabric over it.


You didn't die, Nott. I saved you.


Oh yeah, who has that shit? Yeah, you do, don't you?


See a lot of Bloodborne, actually.


We're not going to worry about that.


That's what I say to myself every morning.


Just looking. Just, you know, people watching.


I'm going to Sacred Flame the other guy.


Nope. So we kidnap the president. (laughter)


Do it anyway. He's at his last legs. It would be epic, Scanlan.


Acrobatics check or save?


Critical Brawl. We just barefist it.


We're like a giant fart.


It's tied up to the dock.


That is way better than our first idea, and yet still terrible.


If something bad is going to happen, just shake me.


But Rexxentrum is the capital.


What else?


30 feet. Towards the direction of out. The fuck out.


Not even by eyesight?


Yay! 22!


(quietly) Not tonight!


Well, I can, but I ran out of notches on my belt. (cheering)


Then I'm fine.


Tary, what do you mean you didn't tell him to-- he just did this on --


Not Craven Edge?


Yes! That's the best first kiss. It's someone you care about--


Disadvantage? I already missed.


I come up and say, hey, Sun Tree. Casting Speak With Plants, of course.


I am no longer a bear.


You look really good, Matt.


Our character alignments do matter on how we play the characters, an earlier question.


I think my spell level, so 20.


I think Scanlan actually might have a better chance with Seeming?


I hate it.


Well, then we're going to have to fucking go to the Slayer's Take.


Scanlan, Taryon. Wow.


Not translucent at all, not--


That's deep, Grog. I like it.


Oh well, I'm fucked, then. (laughter)


Well, why don't we be pigeons that can fucking fly?


As expected. Things are about the same between me and Maryanne.


I rolled a one. Are we done taking donations?


I appreciate it (pained sounds).


(slamming)


I show him the rune.


We suspect it.


He's wonderful.


And grateful for it.


Yeah, could we cast Silence?


While they bury bodies, I pull Caleb aside, and say: hey, can I talk to you for five seconds? Ten, maybe, tops. 15. Okay, it might be more like 20 seconds. Will you give me 20 seconds? Over here? No, you know what, it's fine. I can say it in front of everybody. I'm sorry. I wanted to apologize for last night. I got a little aggressive, a little handsy. I shouldn't have done that, I was out of line, and I shouldn't have brought up your past shit. Sorry. See, 20 seconds, that was about right? That was good?


What are these? These shirts are in the store right now! And the color, and they're so soft, I'll be petting you guys throughout the whole night.


No, I'm doing Pass Without A Trace.


Oh shit! Percy!


I have everything that I own on me. Am I missing anything?


Please be careful for a moment. Can someone cover her ears for just a second?


Was the first roll. And the second--


Would you be willing to give me a boost up that wall?


Oh, 34.


Okay, I'll do a spiral. Like a spiraly ramp that traps him in.


Hey, Kiki. Good morning.


So there's a walkway, but there's also lava?


Yeah. I'm looking at it. Yeah, advantage versus magic on his saving throw.


Is she going to give us a place to stay tonight?


They’re hefty, too.


We have a rope.


But you don't have to leave the table.


Oh, I know, I know, it's terrible!


Bad influences, all of you. Assholes.


I'll land us at the treeline.


Whomp-whomp.


Oh, one more save. Ugh.


I guess I stealth behind him.


Winston.


Right, you did say that.


Permanent Jenga.


That's good, that's good. Should we ask the nearest? Where's the nearest entrance?


I was very hungry.


I'll stay awake.


My name is Taliesin Jaffe. I'm a voice actor, director, and I've been playing some form of Dungeons & Dragons, and if you can't tell by my black clothing, a lot of Vampire the Masquerade when I was a teenager. There was a problem. I'm playing Percy, the Gunslinger. I'm the reason all the rules are all messed up.


Echoes in the field. (echoing sounds)


We have asked everyone in this bar about everyone else in this town except for Al Gore. I don't think that we have, no. We have not.


Yeah, this is the beautiful deluxe edition which comes with a little ribbon and you can see this wonderful cover art with Vecna in the center and the four gods depicted in the corners all cowering before his might.


He's all right, he's all right, he's all right. I've got a healing potion and I'm pouring it--


Is it watery in this?


This is your spot, this is your spot! And I creep towards the trees, a tree closest to me, so I can get closer. Which is the orc that's throwing the javelins on that map?


I have a small package and letter that I want to deliver to Kerr before we leave, but other than that.


We have a wine cellar.


Can't be.


Do I get any more damage because of the--


We could ask you for days off sometimes.


Can I roll to see if I'm fearful?


You said that in this bar.


Okay. That's reduced by-- Oh. How much--


I see stone, acid, a very handsome gnome-- oh wait, that's me. And a big button that I just pressed.


Back in the mansion, maybe.


I want to know what she's reading.


Can you make us a bridge, Keyleth?


How do the ducks know that?


Push-ups for seven days; here we go!


I'm going to teach Twiggy all about The Traveler. He's pretty cool.


I know I'm not one usually to speak up, but because I know so many of you and some of you are family-- (blows kiss) Um, we-- I'm sure you guys have heard because of the party and festivities from last night, the dragon has been killed.


(scared noises) I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.


I don't know what to say! Oh god, I'm like, going to cry.


She's quite pleasant, actually.


Okay, so it's taking damage, too. That's good. Maybe.


Wait! I turn to Vex. Vex, does your Hunter's Mark tell you where they went? They just disappeared. Where'd they go?


A beam of red light.


Retaliation? That's new.


I take off run - oh, she's by herself.


Zero. 19!


I haven't actually damaged him yet, have I?


Yes.


Oh, you mistake me, Seer of the Herd. I do not mean to lead this herd, but rather to empower you to more powerful game. I'm here to inspire your aspirations. Never would I ask you to bend the knee. Only would I ask you to live and fight and perhaps die in the most beautiful death you can possibly attain. Join me and my fellows. Come to our aid when I call. And with that, we will chase down dragons, gods, and more.


Vax has been laughing hysterically, giggle fits, clutching his ribs the entire time. And then is there any of the staff here? Anyone that's here? Anyone else?


We can put them in our hair.


I have that darkvision, too. That's not bad. 17.


This is a powerful creature.


Is she under arrest? We don't know.


I think he will.


I wanna just pay off that docks comment, really. (all laugh)


The Iron Shepherds. We could lure them into the woods.


Yeah, it's still a little soggy and damp.


Kash walks over and heals Kima.


1d8. Not raging.


Fjord, will you look at my eye? I think there's something still in here.


This cost us a thousand gold.


Backblaze is unlimited cloud backup for Macs, PCs, for just $5 a month. You can back up your fanart there, your fanfiction, the dirty stuff, photos, videos, drawings, documents, it's everything. I actually use this service. My stuff is continually uploading to the cloud and I always know it's there for when my hard drive crashes, they'll send you a new one in the mail--


Happy birthday.


It's good to camp.


No I need a--


Oh, well, I'll stop there.


Although that will be good because if I go right before Yasha. That means that I can--


That code is 'critrole'. Critrole. You get free shipping if you type in 'critrole', but you got to do it on their website, not other websites.


I was going to say, the quilt from your grandmother.


What did you come to Trostenwald for?


It's not D and D Beyond, it's D N D Beyond. You don't want to type in an "and," because that will take you to a porn site.


Yeah, yeah, let's stealth.


Song for Grog.


He's so cute.


If that's what we planned, sure.


I know a particular spell that it's rather wonderful. And I go blow a stream out and do a cantrip, Control Magic, and start doing a nice dragon fire dance that I know of from my home.


All you've got to do is get away for this to be amazing.


You can, on the other hand, use--


I'm going to go towards Keg.


I'm an independent woman, all right?


If we say "bidet?"


We're going to be fine. It's nothing we can't handle.


The people of this town are-- you know that they're grateful. The problem is, for some of you, they may not be able to say that in a way that you can hear right now. But know that they are, and know that they will be for a long time. And if I have anything to say about it, it will be a very, very long time. So thank you. Thank you for them, and thank you for me.


It really is pretty nice, isn't it?


You were the softness that we needed--


Would Trinket's little feet hurt if he was on the ground?


Just looking out, looking, drawing, I'm very distracted.


-- some fucknut with one eye. I feel like--


A potion of waterbreathing?


I got it down already. (laughter)


I'm never going to wash it again.


And this has been--


Should we take a group look for the top of the spire?


How close am I?


It's exciting. (laughs)


She'll be fine. She'll be safe.


It's right up your alley. Tracking, hunting.


Yeah, I'll go with you.


Well, so no more healing. But we could fly right up there and break that thing.


Is there 230,000 gold worth?


I have Conjure Animals, not Woodland Beings.


All she'd have to do is fly just off the-


DM, question. The two zombified back at the circus tents, were they burnt to a crisp beyond recognition?


Okay, no that's fine. Oh, I wouldn't have heard?


I'm not condescending Pike, I am rationalizing this agreement.


I can try and Stone Shape through it.


What are your ambitions with it?


We burned through that ages ago.


I have to make a constitution saving throw to keep the spell. Okay, strength save. Nine.


I think we'll get a little closer.


He said he wants the day.


Do you have any good terrain modifier something to trash them?


Is anybody here, like, in the room right now behind me? Are they present at the Trial Forge very often? Hey, don't be so obvious. (laughter)


No book?


Persuasion with advantage? That's good! I got a natural 18 with a plus one, so 19. Just being real vague.


Until we meet again. All of us. Until we all meet again. Always a pleasure. Ah, keep safe, and--


Tiberius, really?


Well, we've got to figure out what we--


If you need us, blink of an eye. Blink of an eye, we'll come back.


(fart noise) Raaaah! Goosh.


Mama Pike!


What? We don't have faith at this table!


We're trying to find him? Where he lives? Who he works for?


I cast Pass Without a Trace on both of us.


I'm going to close my eyes and be like, Sarenrae, I really believe in you. You're so holy, and very divine and beautiful, and I think you do really good things for Pike, and I'm very happy about that.


Yeah. I think it will be a parlay, unfortunately.


Yep. Sharpshooter and with deadeye.


You're a bird.


Try pushing the door.


Yeah, I would be calling out this whole time which ways we want to go to get out, ja.


Dang it, maybe we can still talk.


I mean, we tell the truth, we did nothing wrong.


It's more than an expression, it's legitimately something you do. Unfortunately, you need salt for that.


That's an arcane effect. Okay, so, Grog might be on his own for a little bit. Okay. So can I heal Scanlan and then also rub some basilisk blood on Tiberius?


We have chain. Grog has chain.


Maybe I can paint something on the sail so it looks like a different boat.


So it'll be faster.


I pick up the glaive also.


All right. Well, we'll see how things go. Let's do a sharpshooter shot at him right now. Let's see what a little bit of damage does to him. So sharpshooter with Retort. Don't miss. And my pistol goes (breaking sound). (groaning)


Also, sausages are very inexpensive, so we have that as a Plan B.


Indeed. I was thinking that we might try and get Horris out now. That way, if a crownsguard finds its way here-- maybe we should take him into the sewers, get him out of the city.


Suck it. It happens.


Both are up.


I suppose I could, but there's a good chance she'll kill you, me, and everyone around at the same time.


While that's going on, can I fly down and get Percy out of the muck and bring him up into the tree?


That's a two.


We, once again, put misinformation out about the boat.


20 percent of the damage?


Sex bacon. (laughter)


You'd be amazed at how people deal with a grieving process. I mean, you're going through it right now.


What time is it? I mean, we don't know what time it is.


Not an acrobatics check, I take it?


All right. Yeah, put me in for one. I'll try anything once.


It's going to be a giant dick and balls if we do.


Oh, I left my keys in there! (laughter)


I have a question for you real quick.


That reminded me of the old home games quite a bit.


Lemonhead, I think is the name of the company? Lemonhead?


Trecorum Satis Dee. You're welcome.


At the blacksmith's?


34.


We get far enough outside of the city so at the very least--


Six cubes, Sam, six cubes.


What's going on? What are we doing?


Here's a question. Rather than scouting here, digging a hole, and going back to our mansion, should we just have a new mansion here?


I gave Vex the Hunk of Quall.


Do something to that little ball.


He's going to turn into powder.


As being worn by the buff and glorious Sam Riegel. Gorgeous. Just gorgeous, with all the tour cities on the back and everything. And then, also, a commemorative item for the hundredth episode. We worked with David Mack-- Who is, like, this amazing artist. He's-- you know him. Tell some of his work, 'cause--


I'm just saying, if Pike is fading on us, it might be best to send her out to lead the rebels.


I think we're already on our way, aren't we?


By the way, we need seven more subs, which is ironically the same number of heads the hydra has.


Is it Pass Without a Trace you're looking at?


It's tough.


(whispers) There's something down in this hole. Do you think you could hold on to this tightly while I climb down?


The wine was a poor choice. It was a good wine, but it was a poor choice.


Well, we could just keep walking.


If only somebody hadn't sent it away! Which is, by the way, chasing behind us still.


You definitely do not have to.


He just made himself a giant target. "Wait!"


I have a thing. Might be helpful while we're here.


Fish skin!


First shot, I'm going to take the Animus, and I'm going to try for a trick shot, for an arm shot. One for Grit, and just for safety's sake-- no, that's all. That's a 31 to hit.


Yeah, we've got something special planned, but I don't know if it's official yet, but I think that we are going to be celebrating Pride Month, and we may have a special guest. I can't say for sure, but we're going to be talking.


Question  is the humans' visibility shit right now?


And you're on fire.


Just seven that time.


She did have a reaction! Can she use a reaction?


Please tell me this is true.


I made a bad call.


Yeah, but we could take out the entire city.


He just flipped it inside out!


If they are safe to touch, but don't use your fingers.


You old so-and-so.


Are you ready for this, Vaxy?


Lost count.


Scanlan--


Quite far north. Right? I'm from the north?


When he walks back.


Should I expedite this?


That's definitely a fairy tree. I'm going to stay clear. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back to the party and tell them what I see.


Leave the mug.


Cleared out.


I think this is a conversation that can continue through Marquet. I don't think we're going to come up with the best idea tonight.


30?


Have you been hugged in a year? Has anyone given you a hug? I give him a hug.


Yep, that hits.


I was trying really hard here.


"Are you okay?"


Great entertainment.


35, okay. So that's those. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Oh, that's before the modifier.


Probably the celebratory first night.


100% busy, not maybe busy, maybe she's sleeping, maybe she's out for a walk.


Whoa, this is a cute house!


I'll keep the herbs.


Hold on, as he falls-- do I still have a movement after this?


Follow the water towards the light. Right?


This is great. Don't worry.


Is it... no...


(sings) I want to fly away.


Did I find anything on that snake guy?


Do a perimeter check?


(sighs) That's the question. It depends on if we're going to decide to--


No, I don't.


5.9, 6.2, 6.3--


Roll your extra thing.


Okay, under the castle, yeah.


You don't have any potions left?


Stay clear if what you do is cast spells. Don't get up in the fray.


Brian has to pay me to be anywhere within 500 feet of him. It's the rule.


Yordee yorda--


Has it been long enough that it's attuned?


I love you! (sizzling)


Do you have coin?


Fuck, never mind. Actually, no, that's not true. I will take my bonus Healing Word to toss another Healing Word, just 1st-level, over to Gern.


Just straight into it!


Lucien, at the table, is fine.


I thought I might have needed it on the thing, but I rolled a natural 20 on my sack check.


The strength was 24.


It's completely smooshed off of the dice!


I have a process. It goes into my iPhone folder, and then right into Dropbox.


Yeah, are we good, guys? Are we good? What's going on over there? There's lots of people pulling out their hair.


And I'll say, oh, you're friendly with these people as well?


Do you really want to?


Oh, poor thing.


You need a tart?


If I go this way--


There is some sort of trapdoor in the center of that building that I don't think is mirrored by any of the rooms that I was able to see on the outside of the building. So it's like a donut with a hole in the middle, is where, maybe, what you're looking for.


All right, let's go for it. I'm going to-- I'm just going to show where I want him to drop.


Is this going to be a long fight? I'll do all three charges of the Ring of the Ram, and punch a baby.


Okay. You know what? You're reading the book on the Nine Hells. That'll tell us what fiends there are.


I wrote a play, okay?


You'll have to be more specific than that.


Anyone need some healing? Are we all okay? Are we all good?


I rolled a one. I don't know anything's wrong.


Feel pretty good about that.


I'll actually-- I've got a great idea.


Yasha, do you have any healing potions?


Okay, well it took off flying, so that sucks.


Pass.


Let's not do that.


If you get poisoned, I can un-poison you!


Stealthy!


Grace of the Platinum Dragon.


Does anyone want to be invisible for an hour?


Oh! Lightning Bolt on the thing with the bad guy. Lightning.


Half and half. Little gold, little silver. Silver and gold.


You just made it three times as complicated in seven seconds.


It's why I don't pull cards!


A critical fail.


That's all we'll need.


2d8 for the axe. 2d8 for 1st-level Divine Smite. Three more for--


We're time jumping.


So you're just offering us a place to stay? You don't want anything out of this?


Sybaritic?


Pretty good song.


Wait, Grog is dead?


Okay. I'll slowly start dragging him to this tree over here. So we can tie him up.


Oh, he's flanked.


We'll just make her last.


I'm at 51 hit points. I'm fine. Oh yeah, so that's-- where is that? 4d6, okay. Ooh! 15 points of damage.


Is she blinded?


We will tell him delicately to kneel and crawl.


We do not!


Is it possible to sneak into his room, and restore him without anybody knowing?


Then if I did this, can I just continue to saw in the same direction and do an attack?


And then I'm going to use the rest of my turn to, if possible, open that door and get behind it for cover, of that room.


I still roll initiative?


That was really lovely.


Who, me? Who, us?


Well, we end up sheltered, don't we?


Do you not still have it written down?


Yes. I forgot.


We're stupid, we could have gone there already.


Do I have any kind of sense of-- Ugh, your Stinking Cloud is right there.


I've dreamed of this place.


Can I get to the doucher?


There's legitimately nothing to be done.


Maybe you should.


Oh, yes, okay! I'll take whatever is on her mouth off.


You were very passionate. You were like, "I need fire water," I said, "okay."


Perpendicular.


Oh, okay. I'll look at that.


Of course he did, he looked us in the eye and he said he killed two people! We should go find them.


(weak laughter)


I have really high initiative.


We have to get him. We have to help him.


About what, about you being shitty? Fuck that guy!


Did you say "clow?"


Percival, even just for intelligence, even if it was brief, even to see what is going on there.


But we still have to get them out of the camp and into the door, unless I make the door in the camp.


I'd like to make my way over to the Iron Stocks.


Hopefully that contains him a bit.


I'll do an Arcana check on her.


Don't be a dick to us. You already said you were scared of us bringing you back to The Gentleman. What are you going to do?


You opened it up to the dice, and the dice decided.


Not of someone I knew.


We made her that armor that we never went back and picked up because we fucked up.


We're really strong.


Well I don't know if I trust her, or what she wants with the sphere. Maybe you should ask her if she knows what it does?


It's cocked. Natural 20. (cheering)


Vax is following.


Give us cover.


It's passé and stupid. I don't want to hear about it.


Yeah. And me with the mantle?


Is that an eye patch?


I had him! (groans)


Should've been a fucking owl.


It could, but it's there. Because it's not anywhere else other than there.


No, there's a lot happening over there.


What percentage of your strength do you shoot it at? 70? 50? 25?


What, what?


So much water on this road!


Better! 26.


Oh, gut. How long have you-- You are very tall.


What's your max?


We sleep longer.


So here's where we don't know what's going on. We got number one, number three, and number five are untrapped, unlocked. Number two and number four are trapped, but I'm just pushing the door open?


We will discuss that when we get out of here.


(yelling) No! No! No! Rip his arm off, Yasha! Don't shoot him!


Maybe it's 10,000.


Great. That sounds good.


No, we're floating above it. We've got advantage.


We can cast it at level three also, which is another--


To me? Yeah? Okay.


Three Amigos?


We're going next to the bridge.


Do you know where she would be at?


It looks really disgusting by the way. It's so gross.


What an asp-hole.


Let's find out. We now know they work.


Oh shit, I just grabbed a bunch of books, but that's the one!


If I read for a few more hours first, sure.


I'm hoping for a conversation to start that I promised I wouldn't start myself. I am trying to keep to the letter of my word.


Oh God. Oh.


I am paying for you. I just put a gold down. Keep the tip as well.


So doorway, brazier, mirror.


There are other ways of being a hero than being an adventurer. There are a lot of ways you could be a hero.


While this is going on  Percival.


Did I skip? Did I skip? It says on my page! I'm sorry!


Nothing. You're fine. Love you very much.


Oh, of course. Always.


I'm going to take that, that's a 13, sorry, ten, nope, 11! Math.


Is that why you have blood on your mouth? Were you filing your teeth last night?


Or do we want to branch out?


And I'm putting it away, so.


I'm probably in the back since I was the last to move.


I step back.


You do what?


What does she wield usually?


- than the images I saw.


What is the problem with that?


There was pissing, there was kissing, there was everything!


I'll just call it a stone of warmth.


I hope it's a terrible drawing of some-- sorry.


Oh no. Plus ten?


Okay, that's better. Intelligence check, 20. Couldn't be more different.


Yes, Grog, you're the best.


Wait, that seems much higher than 20 feet.


Should we all turn into birds and confuse him?


I feel like Caleb could have done it.


I say, "Don't laugh at my friend!" and I'm going to send my lollipop over and hit it in the face.


See those acrobatics checks...


No, I'm just looking to see what I can see. Like one leg up, Captain Morgan style.


Don't do it, Grog! Do not do it yet!


Goddamn it, this hopefully works-- nope.


Quiet is good.


I heal 24 points of hit damage.


Anyway.


I pick up his clothes and I put them in the Bag of Holding.


Do you have your orb?


Do I roll, or do I use these stats?


Now taking the stage, it's Mollymauk!


Potentially. It could shit out a lot of dwarven zombies.


Oh yeah. Sorry for being a pessimistic asshole, by the way, when we first came into town.


It's the Stormlord. I don't know if you know of him.


Theoretically wiped my people off the face of the planet.


I'm going to move through the group, directly counter to him, behind the statue.


Well, he or she or whatever it was.


With my good hand, yes.


I yawn and then go into a stance.


That's not the dice he rolls for attacks! (laughter)


Yeah, never mind.


(regular voice) Oh, it's my turn! Oh no, that's your line. Wait, that's my line. Okay. (exaggerated Scottish accent) What ya doin the weekend? Jings! You're a right hoodie dobber, ye are, pure walloper--oot yer nut!


Yes, 'cause Keyleth does definitely-- Keyleth and a lot of the other Ashari dealt with a little bit of guilt after Cinderking Thordak, and wanted to make sure that if anything tragically goes wrong again, we can potentially be faster to respond. And have allies nearby. So that was a massive part of it. I also went to Whitestone and grabbed a little sprig off of the Sun Tree to propagate one of my own trees back in Vesrah. Spent a lot of time working on my alchemy, in between. I imagine we have would have crafting parties in Whitestone, yeah? And then, you know, I would do some alchemy.


I can't remember. I think you just--


The Braving Grounds, we could see if they need any-- since we-- I lost us a lot of (tearing up) money.


Yeah, where's he?


We could also try to get inside and get the chains because they are scared of those and--


Yeah. I'll get one, whoever's closest to me.


I have advantage.


I'm trying to even conceive of a machine that could move this. But I don't understand why it's here in the first place.


But I don't wanna break it! Don't pull so hard that you break it!


Can you do something with that? Okay, never mind, then.


Just the tip.


I didn't say I Hunter's Marked him at the beginning-- I'm explaining this to you guys, because I'd already said I shot at him.


Say this is-- This is not the kind of Hunt that I am used to! And I try to shoot him.


True, yeah. Are there any books in his room specifically for Caleb?


He just ran back down.


What was that word in there? Classy?


He done been bifurcated.


Maybe the only thing he knows.


Okay. 12, nine, and a six.


Mouths are for eating, not for talking.


Wait. Do I say that? No last name given?


You've successfully secured deez nuts.


What, really?


Well, one. Hopefully.


Can I Alter Self to a succubus?


Oh my God! That means we get Grog back!


I'm going to open the gable windows, if they open, and jump out them.


Looks like Italy.


I think I'm fine. I'm just wet.


Let's hear it also for the app called Waze, which got me here at 7:20 instead of 7:45.


I hug her back from behind.


Dabdrist Cojo?


Oh, we just rested. Shit.


But keep on the lookout for mandrakes.


I'm going to make a run for cover towards the-- where's the laser pointer?


I forget I can do that wherever I go, and I never get the chance.


Do it, Tom Cruise.


All right. Yes. Fine. Take five minutes, six minutes, and--


Yeah, I mean that's a 23. Sorry, yes, 23.


Well, I'm so glad you did. How in the world did you find out that I was here?


Wait, whoa.


The Duke that was formerly known as--


Or has a terrible cold.


Ready? Ready? Everybody join hands, join hands, join hands.


What's your name, young lady?


Help me, Yasha!


Oh, do I?


That's pretty good. 25.


All right, I give it a little lift.


Yeah. Percy, maybe me and you should make some reinforcements or something?


All right, then I'm going to try for elementals.


That's where I was going. Is there any merit in trying to get a hold of Wilhand right now, while they're here?


And I say, Grog, meet Fassbender. Fassbender, Grog.


Not a lot. What did I say, six?


Not to the boat! Never to the boat!


Go go go!


I might have been using my flashlight, I would imagine.


Plus, oh.


I mean, I don't have any powdered gems, but I could probably powder some gems.


No. This is the second one. This is the first Flurry of Blows I'm doing.


If Scanlan were here, he'd moon and blind all.


That's where the acid pits are. Acid. Briarwoods. Briarwoods?


It really is. Do you still feel the same way about your teeth?


Everyone is aware that Tiberius is the giant eagles in Lord of the Rings. Tiberius can invoke ultimate destruction at the call of whatever he wants.


There is always some truth to porn.


I agree with that. Are we supposed to do something with the sand?


Can you come help me get this diamond back?


We were talking about planning, and then sleeping, and then going.


But how? It literally involves going to one dragon and saying: Hey, did you hear what that other dragon said about you? That's all I got.


Do you need curing, though? Because your eyes do look bloodshot.


Are there any other guards in the room as we leave?


30 feet. So she stands between. She's going to climb up on-- no, I'm not going to say that. She's going to take a step diagonally down this way and then turnt undead.


Well then we're in trouble, I have an attitude about everything.


We have a plan for getting the crystal, just not how to get the fuck out.


Is is Artagan or Artagan?


Don't touch the giant.


You can't see it because it's inside.


Well, let's general charisma check-- oh, that would be a natural one there.


Okay. I-- what is JB doing?


My breakfast is not tasting as good.


Not quadrupled, oh! So sneak attack is not doubled, then on top-- All right.


4d8, 17 plus 12, 29.


Only subscribers get access to the archives.


And I'm gonna fly back a little so he can see me less. And then I'm going to have Trinket, for my bonus action--


Oh, are we going into our intro?


They're unconscious?


I'm solid with the bat, but I'm going to lead the way since I'm good with directions.


Who else wants to-- Is it just a two-player game?


And here's the thing. There's a thing. There it is, right there. Here's the thing.


Just had a thought, I'm going to sit him back against the wall, and let him slide against it, and grab Scanlan, and into the room.


Is that, like, "Break glass in case of emergency"?


I think we should just ask him.


Let's bundle it up in the tapestry.


But it's not a good price.


It was so cool!


I mean we could hang out in the lobby in this bar, and I could watch every person that comes inside. I could draw their picture and know every single patron that's in here so that we have something to turn into the guards when we rat everybody out.


Well, if--


(coughing) As I cough my way down the chimney, "I'm coming!"


This is a surprise attack, though.


Aw, can we get them? Go get them.


You want me to hide the bodies?


Man, in context that was weird as fuck! I rolled a 19.


(yells) I fall out of the tree.


Unfettered I'm fine with. It's unwatched--


Okay! Good idea!


I don't know, why am I?


Are you cool?


Keyleth just hollers, "Vax! Come sit by me."


Should I run down this tunnel and see what's down here?


Six. Every time!


I can't do that, right?


I think some of my dead comrades we could use as pillows. They're probably still in there.


Okay. Kill it and follow it.


I'm still going to hit you.


Why am I rolling so bad right now?


I'm still doing fine.


Why is he doing the talking? Why is he doing the talking?


Got to go Revenant on that bear!


Dear diary.


You guys rolled 16, yeah.


That explains a lot.


Clarota, I am a fan.


All right, I want to crawl forward to the other side of Grog over there, so I can see this little jerk.


She does an underswing right up between its legs and hits it in the goolies.


We're supposed to advertise!


Yeah, I can heal you and heal you and heal you until you're all done.


It was in Uriel's palace, wasn't it?


That could not have gone better.


Titanfall 2!


Does it have to be a bonus action?


What happens after you research it?


Do I have any more movement left?


Ugh. Again.


Is she giving us a quizzical look, a suspicious look, an interested look?


She was gonna do a Mass Healing--


I'll choose... the door.


I think over-cautious. Even when jumping into the depths of the undead, there's such a thing as over-cautious.


I think we're a bit beyond that, at this point.


Ballsack.


Reckless, great weapon master. 30.


All right. I feel good about this. Now we'll continue our dragon lesson I suppose.


I had a lot of sisters.


Because that's going to be great. God.


Claudia, what are you doing?


Everyone loved the dad hats.


Before we go to Issylra? Wait. Is Vasselheim on Issylra? How close did I recognize the shore--


And his cantrips are-- So if he casts Armor of Agathys, it's going to take up one of his levels.


Look at that pen.


All right, I'll walk through the place and look for sis.


I attack him again. This time I'm going to try as a sharpshooter!


Mercy!


This board is incredible.


Is that with a C or a K?


I'll sit front, so you can have your arms around me.


No, that's not crazy.


Do you want to take the lead?


I like to get away from things sometimes.


Yes it's a Wand of Smiles. They have to roll a DC of ten for charisma saving throw or be forced to smile for a minute.


Well, maybe I shouldn't--


So! As of right now, that shirt is available in the Geek and Sundry store for preorder. It's going to be there for I think two weeks? And it's available in sizes small through 3XL, which we're really excited about. And yeah, so that's that, so.


I don't hear anything, either. I think we should just bust in.


You never noticed him eating people before?


No, I'm holding on to him.


I just don't think it's the best idea to jump into this.


And it will do it over all of the--?


I remember the tunnels sucking booby-trap-wise.


Do you want to shoot me? I'll be okay.


Can I look at the words?


So there's still more content.


I give you my climbing gear because I already get advantage. How about that? Does that count? No.


Oh, it's about all we do.


I heard you saying it, too.


We tell them to stay put, unless they're getting food.


He ate what we had!


Yeah, we're killing everything.


What was our loose plan? We didn't see any of them?


Well, Caduceus, you're definitely coming.


Yeah, he wants to get the fuck out of here.


Can we build one in the hallway leading to this room?


Apparently?


That's right. (clears throat) Do all those things, Scanlan.


Cheers, and god,


So in love with you right now. So in love with you.


No one's around and going to maim me, right?


Yeah, you should.


Wait! I get to reroll something, don't I? Where is it? Where is it? Aw. Do I get a reroll? Yeah. One save reroll per---


Oh, I actually-- I go over to Warra real quick before she walks away? Just to her side, and say, you look well. Have the Seers told you if it's going to be a boy or a girl yet?


Tentacle range?


They are unable to speak a deliberate lie for one minute and all charisma checks have advantage.


Yeah, we'll make our way further into the hold and try to find the source of the voice.


I have no idea what's going even going on.


Tiny!


She's one of us.


No, I cannot do that. I have to stay here in this bubble or the boat will sink, presumably.


Oh, I was thinking I was Keyleth, I'm gonna come up next to Keyleth.


(gasps) It's basically the Vision?


No no no, it's happening.


You know why? We have Pike! That's our other ally. She's here now.


Are you halfway done yet, Groggy?


Let's go. I am going to step out into the street.


It burns a lot.


Friend of yours, or former friend?


That's important. People need to be born.


Let me check-- yeah.


Can I go try to mess with the things on--


You can get all 19s.


I probably have. With that responsibility, I started thinking about the crew, and maybe we haven't been treating them the best that we could be. You know, I think they're okay. I don't think that we're abusing them, but maybe neglecting them? Anyway, I got this extra bottle of mead for them, and I thought maybe, with some of the stuff we got, maybe we could do a nice dinner for them or something to just show our appreciation.


One secret traded for another. It's a fair price, I think.


Now it's definitely going to be stolen. We have one other item. Not that I don't love my posture being corrected.


Oh, are we taking off our shirts? Oh, wait. Wait, what? (shouting, extended) No! [cheering]


Oh Jesus.


Why is he coming towards us?


What if you're on top?


I know, I just want to make sure it was him. Your big mustachioed metal man.


Fucking D&D, man.


No! Would you like some water?


I've come to understand my place in Her sight.


We'll go by Pumat's later. It'll be fine.


And adventure you shall have, my friend.


I thought were going to go for Mighty Nein sponsorship at the Nook.


If it had spelled the end of one of my closest friends I know I would want it, so we should probably keep it for Yasha when she wakes. In the Bag of Holding.


You said 14.


But they could track us back here.


I let go of Nott as soon as we're into the tunnel, away from the coins.


Plus four, so six damage. That sucks.


Do I see anything through the doorway, from where I'm standing?


Yeah, this could be bad. This could be bad.


Seriously?! So one was a 25. And then 17.


It's like "Poor Matt's soul."


I slow fall.


Are there drawings of them?


I thought I was going to still be a lot closer to Nott.


I don't know what's going on. I'm doing the last thing that was on my mind.


And I'll collapse tunnel one?


That's fine, that's fine!


At Gilmore's.


Oh, seven hit points.


(sings victory song) Is the camera on? I can't tell. It's a pencil pack. I asked them to make this, because this is so great. So we all have our own pencils. Everybody has a pencil. We've got the "How do you want to do this?" pencil. We've got the "I would like to rage" pencil. We've got a Scanlan pencil-- oh no, this is a Tary pencil. This is a "Doty, take this down" pencil. I don't want to say all the things because they're so great, but check them out. It's in the store now. Does everybody want their pencil?


Well, you know, it's like a whole thing.


You owe us nothing!


No. No! Come back. No! I will not leave them behind. I want to help them, still.


Where was this place? Where was this place?


(laughs) Oh, 14. I'm sorry. I can't remember. Oh, plus ten. 24.


Is there any way to get rid of them forever?


Yes. I did.


Yeah, go ahead, okay.


Can I see whose voice that was?


Can I try reaching with my hands and pulling?


I want you to know this is nothing personal but this is--


150 feet.


Pike, you know the Ozmit Sea. You've sailed it, yeah?


I am Nila. It is nice to meet you all.


Oh, you mean like Senokir?


No, I have one more gun. But I don't have time. That burns an action.


Do we have to break any of the planes of webbing to get to this cluster?


Just before we move  the names that Dad had told us about to maybe parlay with in the Myriad?


Hit his ribs? Okay! Hearing Jester, I'm going to do Flurry of Blows, which I wasn't going to do, but hearing Jester, I'm going to because I felt so fucking inspired. I'm going to, leaning off of the ogre, do like a (pop pop pop pop) into his ribs.


To be honest, you seem like you got your goolies burned there just from a conversation, a little bit.


You know, it went about as well as one could expect?


Really quick, just look around, is there anything of value to grab before we run?


You said twenty feet?


I'll walk in and give them a nod, and then go get an ale. First things first.


All right, go. What is it?


How much for the cup?


You our posse now.


(quietly) Oh my god.


Then who cast Seeming on you?


Fine. Take all the joy out of everything.


Wait. There's one last thing.


Yep, I'll Disguise Self to look like a crownsguard.


It's rats!


We need you, Nott.


But no plates.


That's not comforting, Caleb.


Definitely understand. Blur up the stairs, shoot past Percy, shoot past that guy, out the window.


Oh my god. A lot of things have changed in a hot second. Okay. What's going on right now?


You guys know him?


I consider myself a nerd.


No, how disgusting they are, and how disgusting they die.


(shushing) Go ahead. Why am I your worst fear in a carnation?


Pickle Pike!


Yes! That would be hilarious!


That will be difficult to find.


Well, Nott slept in until noon, so we probably left a couple of hours after that.


I mean, no. I don't think I ever had a penpal.


Horses don't try to steal your soul, Grog.


I'm going to Cutting Words that, with my reaction.


I'm sure you could make it look a little prettier than it is but--


Yeah. 23 for investigation.


And yourself, Pike.


I really don't--


I wanted to go with Nott, about 20 feet behind, and cast Mage Armor as I go.


I left a magic dump.


Yeah, your max plus two.


Crutch, will you--


I'm going to tell the horses to whoa.


Carpenter, captain, so we need a boatswain.


Oh, it's on the floor right there.


Roll with it, roll with it.


No! Terrible idea.


(whispers) Oh my god. I wish we had popcorn!


Yeah, all right, thank-- you're welcome. Thank you.


We got to go!


Reckless, all the stuffs.


No. I'm sure they're wonderful, though. That sounds just great. That sounds wonderful. Friends! (sigh) You have come. (sigh) Please, let me know what I can do for you. Usually when people come here, it is because of some great tragedy. How can I alleve your pain?


Yeah. A little crazy?


I can't figure out what's going on. Ugh, balls. Oh, wait. 16?


We're not like Wonder Woman inside the jet? What about my hand hanging out?


I'll try the door.


Whoa, you pass out the 26 gold?


Thank you. (laughing) That.


This Elder Scrolls music is pretty dope.


She needs a bucket of Vaseline, a feather, preferably from a dove, and 35-40 minutes.


Can we hold it?


I was aware it could go horribly wrong, which is why I was prepared to say something.


-- I do have Zone of Truth.


Jesus. Ugh, you're the worst!


All right. So we have to worry about you, Grog.


You know, just to close out the night with a subscriber-only chat to say thank you to our thousand subscribers. And tomorrow night we will be back with So You Don't Have to, which is a show where Hector and Becca play the weirdest games they can find online, so you don't have to.


I'll make you something fancy that's a little less prone to explode.


Vex, I bet if you go real fast, you can totally make it.


Three rooms?


Ex-squeeze me?


Pike--


I'm going to keep heading towards the cart to see if that goblin is still there.


Whitestone Atlas Obscura.


This is no less or more. There's a risk either way. It's just the risk of running or the risk of staying.


It works. It doesn't get pierced from the inside. It can only be pierced from the outside, right?


Does that not work? Shit. Wasted a rage.


Okay. I'll try to pick it again, I guess.


It's an odd choice of words, but now 30 seconds later, I see what you mean


Yes, that's the rule.


Should I? Okay. But it's dead. What time is it now?


Keep a dream journal.


Roll! Two.


We have a Bag of Holding. Oh, there's a giant monster. I Hunter's Mark it. Is it close by?


It's time to ring this bell.


21st.


Who is?


They wanted to move. Well--


We're already in the giant battle.


That's a big-ass road.


That's real sexy.


Catch phrase! Catch phrase! Meme! Tweet tweet tweet!


I've written many a song about you, it's true.


Level one?


Things that you could use for your research. Historical items.


How many Sunbeam hadoukens do you have left, Keyleth?


No dexterity, no nothing?!


You should open your eyes, though.


I just want to heal her. Oh, I rolled really low. Six.


What is our next-- Shoot, I kept a to-do list for us, but I didn't bring it tonight.


You're good with animals, though.


No, no, literally hell.


200 gold.


It's a falchion!


I know, Nott! I know you did. I was just joking with you.


That is a fair point.


What about Artagan? That's his name, right?


Break it!


And Vanessa really likes you.


I will be behind the pillar over there.


'Cause the Earth Ashari are on the eastern side of the continent. Right?


I think it is going to be a little bit beyond your capabilities to destroy this bowl, Yasha.


First roll to hit.


The future's so bright.


From the darkness, she strikes!


No, of course.


Gnomeless.


Yes, fog monster.


Thank you. I've picked everything out myself. This is all put together.


I mean it might just be a lich phylactery or something.


Meat salad. You're welcome.


Cows have eight stomachs?


Yeah, give it a try!


Oh, I see you got some blondies.


He knows where Vecna is?


That's me, can I use it on a robot?


All right. I will try to hit him with a Lightning Bolt, but miss as many people as possible.


It'll eventually just be like (grunts).


Oh, fuck that shit, I'm rolling through.


Oh, god, one's on the ground.


Just get me to him. Don't drop me, just get me there. We've got to pull out all the stops. It's all or nothing.


It hasn't washed out yet, but it's fun for a little bit, just to try something.


No, I'm going to whack the dude.


Oh, the bakery! I'm really bad at baking too.


Maybe he knew where to go, and he was heading there to get his gift.


Six, seven feet.


I can choose the other, the other guys in the cage?


Trinket's back on the other side.


Exactly!


Love the way you're rolling today.


No, we could just tie him to a chair or something.


I go up and check. I got a-- oh wait, disadvantage, I'm drunk. That's a 19.


Beau’s unconscious again.


(cackles) This is your doing!


Well, this was peaceful--


Those crossbeams, do they look like they're structurally integral to the room?


Hot metal bends.


There is a lot of history for Percy wrapped up in this and he has done you wrong, no question. But the answer is yes. You will be separate from Percival. You will be protected. And you have my word.


Antlers upon antlers.


Oh, I'll do that, then. I'm going to start, with the rope wrapped around, start like a lifeguard, backing out.


Broke the DM, ten points. Boom! (laughter)


You want to chase them?


Is she just getting high?


Enough to negate the disadvantage?


Oh god! Did we get alcohol? Did someone give us alcohol?


I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at third level into a group, the group. At Kevdak.


I can't cast Haste. I don't know it.


Okay, so I walk and I sink into the ground as I'm walking off, and I want to pop up next to this guy.


He got a eight.


Ooh. Ooh! That's a good thought. We kill all of them. No.


I would like to leave the "VM" seal on the side of the cavern.


A rambling de Rolo.


I feel like that was worth pointing out.


I want that one!


Okay. This one.


Who is all in the room? Is it the four of us?


Look look look!


I'm going to keg stand there. I'm proud of you, Sam.


Yeah! That was a good gamble!


I would like to run a quick perception test.


And a seashell bra.


Wait! Before you go, could I talk to you?


Well, I'm going to pop in and check really quickly, just letting you know.


They've gone into hiding.


Is there free booze?


Okay, can I get like an odd estimate of maybe how many gnolls we might be dealing with based on the amount of tracks?


Yeah, that sounds good.


I'll wait for him to text me first. Yeah. It's the rule. Long time.


Any questions?


Do you want advantage or do you want that extra d4?


Being in costume for it and everything.


It's blocking my face, but I want to see it.


They are not.


I don't think that's--


We recapped this at the break, too! Damn it!


New level. Hope it was worth it.


Oh, be pleased.


I mean our group is pretty good at causing distractions.


The room won't fit my storm cloud?


Well, technically, wait, hold on.


Do you think he would know if the Xhorhas invasion at the same time as our little plan was a bigger conspiracy? Were we set up?


How do we disarm a trap?


Shrinks as it leaves.


Who says it's mine? It could be any of ours. I mean, mine's a little busted, though, so it would be nice.


I'm fucking sitting on the ground; there's nothing else I can do.


Oh, no, that was Caleb who was freaked out by fire.


Yeah. We're going to be rocking out Nightmare tomorrow night, and Felicia's probably going to be stopping by, and Ryon Day. We're going to have a big old Halloween party with Rock Band and everything else. So you guys are more than welcome to join us and celebrate Halloween.


I bring out a piece of gold. Please, sir, we're looking for a place to stay that isn't covered in mud.


Where is that? Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, okay. It's a 16.


No. Nothing really. But I saw the Traveler, so that's good news, everyone. He's still around, he's here. He's probably hanging out with us right now.


Stop antagonizing the Grog statue.


Wait-- oh, she attacks with advantage.


All right. Cool, cool, cool. Cool. Okay. I'm gonna try to get Grog out of the grasp again with my Grasping Vine.


Well, one of us.


And it's dark out now, yeah?


Two map night!


That was really smart, Grog.


It just says, "a creature within 30 feet."


No type of landmark?


No, we should really have Caleb look at this. He's much smarter than any of us down here.


I actually think it did. Actually.


That's all they say.


Let's let people know.


Wait, are we interesting?


Am I seeing anything out on the water?


33 was the total.


(whispering) You were talking about some poison resistance.


Is it possible they haven't seen us yet?


DC equals ten plus the spell's level.


It's already Fessuran!? It feels like "Huvnufn."


Are you going to carry that on your back?


(gritty voice) I wish to observe.


Oh no, really?


It's like Yelp. But better. I'm going to knock. (knocking)


Oh, yeah. Give him a shot.


I saved for it.


Hi. You have rooms, yes?


Five, for the moment. He knows there's three of us.


Everyone's just be like, "Wow!"


Hey there new guy, you know good words that like sound cool in Zemnian right?


We got to fucking try it in gold! Try it in gold. Maybe try it in gold.


Thank you for trusting us with that, Yasha.


Yes, if you guys could lend your positive energy it would be very helpful.


The first attack was 16, but it was cocked.


Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. 15. No, wait. 17.


No, I'm four.


I mean, there's a lot going on right now.


Oh, your flask runs out?


Not anymore. Burny-burny, ashy-ashy. Bye-bye.


How about Yasha? Did Yasha roll?


We can teleport.


Yeah, I get it. So, everyone wants my bod. I'm going to take three slashes with the sword again since I'm too close to use the guns.


It's everything I could've wanted.


Do we smell any brimstone?


Is there any other shitty bragging anyone else would like to do?


Towards that pulsing light.


Okay, I'm going to try something weird, here.


I like this one. I'll go get my green beetle armor.


Dispel magic.


Can I go and loot the giant that's not frozen?


Now we rest up. You heal, and you get ready to attack tomorrow.


And also sometimes, those birthrights are thrust upon us.


Time to snuggle up, Beau!


I'm not in it.


First thing we want to do is run away. Can we get out of the range of the eye somehow?


Bishaft?


Would you repeat that last phrase please, DM?


Want to do one more hour and call it?


I could take a crack at it. The wagons be hitched, hee-haw.


Well, one healer's kit. She's got the other one.


Unless it melted.


I'm disappointed in us.


It's where they always are.


Yes, that's what I mean! He's got to make a wisdom save of 15.


She can't, I don't think she's wearing the earring. Unless she put it back in.


You're a celebrity!


It's not! I should have grabbed Mass Cure Wounds, but I was wrong. So I grab Percy and I say: Fucking finish this bitch. Finish this. I let him go, and that's my turn. Healing Percy.


Yeah. Plus three. It’s 2d6 plus three.


Giant, Common.


Grog, Pike, Vex, Vax, Percy, Keyleth.


I'll tell you what we could do. There's a joint stop on the trade routes, an island called Brokenbank, we could make it there. I'm familiar with how we would get there and we could try and find some extra hands.


Yep. Little bit of magic on both sides, little bit of tank.


All right, 20 for me.


Fuck, no, not ready, but we can do it.


To get up?


A better idea, perhaps, is for one of-- You're able to disguise yourself, right?


Sorry, nerds. I don't play this version.


52?


Anything not to go unconscious again.


Did you see it?


I'm going to attack him with my Bramble Shot. With the Blazing Bowstring. Ooh, yeah. That's a 31.


Pay the dwarf.


Okay, that's a 15?


Rustic!


Survival? 18.


Just going for it?


Who's the Gentleman?


Is it a straight d20?


Sachet.


We can't walk over there without disturbing candles, right?


18 plus 11, so 29.


Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or anything?


I don't know. Are we?


Oh, I was going to say  I go get Fjord.


We can fly up and just drop him down like a big, giant bomb.


Oh, we're shit at climbing!


No, I mean, I talk about everything with you guys.


Cool, then since he's got my brother next to him, I'm gonna fly down so I can see him better, and shoot him two times with my blazing bowstring on the first one.


I'll hold it up. Is the eye doing anything other than casting that glowing light?


Where am I at?


What if I go find the High-Richter and ask for her autograph?


Thank you so much. You don't understand what this means.


Scanlan, you got me killed!


With an I or a Y?


Ah! Can I run as far as I can this way?


All the papers. All the papers in the world.


It's reality seeping into our game a little bit.


Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere? Not even an inch?


Bastard. Treat her well or I'm going to come back.


You are all accomplices. I just want to point that out.


I don't know if that's a good reason to say yes, though.


Okay. Here it is.


Sunlight and water. Fresh water.


We're on a jet ski; this is great!


Two boxes?


Spike!


Yes, we will definitely do that. Absolutely. Yeah. You need to use that skill more often. You know what the problem is, we don't have as many ducks in Ank'harel.


In the ocean?


I don't think he's going down with it.


Oh yeah, I have the disguise charm.


I've already thought about it.


He's going to be super pissed.


I'm stealthing. I'm stealthing down the steps.


Whatevs.


But don't lick, Trink, please.


Maybe you don't say anything. (laughter)


Okay. 13 points.


Do you ever sleep, Jarett?


Let me see how many spells I have left. I think I do. Yeah, I can do Pass Without a Trace, I have a couple left.


Shut up! I gotta savor this.


Okay! I was wondering if you could point us towards an inn, or the Keystone Pub maybe?


Ugh. I'm so tree-lagged, though.


That's the only time Marisha has ever said those words. (laughter)


A man of few words.


We were on very secret business for the crown, actually. And that is why you weren't informed of our business.


Grog. Tary.


What is that, constitution?


If we have to eventually (throat croaking).


Do you really want this? Do you really want this orb though?


They could have magic in their possession, they could use magic as well, so let's move.


Is there a good part?


He's a frenzied solo? What does that mean?


Yeah. There's been some really phenomenal--


Does it feel like water?


Algar, not Aldar.


Can I do an insight check to see if I can glean any more of what he knows about this world-ending thing?


Damages?


Her ex?


So it's the earlier.


No! I would so lose.


Not our best show.


Whatever you do, I can get me plus eight other people through with Plane Shift. Eight willing creatures.


10d10. Or no, sorry, sorry. 7d10. Wait. Let me double-check. Let me double-check what it is.


It's not fucking Gustav.


I saw them. I saw them!


Just don't touch anything.


I got an eight. I'm way at the bottom.


Steampunk Burning Man!


You should never lie to your mother.


Ah, that makes sense. Do I see it now?


Take your earring off, put it on silent if you ever want to fall asleep.


Eight. Not so good.


Apparently he can.


I'm feeling pretty good about this one.


While he was talking to the shopkeeper, I'm going to take out as many books as I can and move them around on the shelves, and then take some of them and turn them around to where their binding is facing the inside.


Beau and Ken. (laughter)


This is a bonus!


Shit, wait. Wait.


Well I was kind of on the bottom, but we'll let it--


Captain Fjord?


Yeah, but Keyleth is right behind him.


I've got six spaces of movement in my turn.


Yeah, I am. I think that's right, 26.


We should get out of here!


We will not kill you.


Was that a crit?


We all need to go up there anyway because that's where the trees are that we're going to transport through, right?


That's a pretty big matzo ball.


Wisdom save of 15.


Maybe add his last name, Dyomin?


Hold it up, show him.


It feels a little cowardly.


God-mode!


Heh, you're dead.


No, yeah, that's great.


And this fellow who died worked with the fishermen in the lake?


Buenos noches, I am the masked vigilante named Storro. I fight injustice and defend the innocent in order to send them to the D&D Beyond Store-o.


In the Bag of Holding?


I'm just going to reel straight up. And on my way up, I'm going to take two more shots at the brain.


He's going to slow us down.


I will need about an hour of time; I'll probably head upstairs. Do you have a pot I could borrow?


Let's put it in the key.


Then no, we'll stealth our way.


I'd assume they'd stay on the estate.


No. She's a wily one.


They always fight for the check.


No, never mind, I didn't do it at the time, I can't do it now. No retconning, never mind.


I feel like we've done enough damage for one day.


And you're on your own.


Wait, are we leaving in the morning? When are we doing this?


Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Get back. Back up.


37 points of damage. Strike number two. Natural 20! (cheering)


(tearfully) If you find the remnants of a glorious beard, preserve it.


We're not going to walk in the open.


Just feathers in your face.


She can't see! She's human, too! (laughter)


Did we steal that? I thought it was just a--


My Locate Object never pinged? My Incantation of Isolation Locate Object?


This is so prehistoric!


Oh man. You just triple lutzed over Purvan and flew beyond.


The Game of Logic by Lewis Carroll.


Maybe we can perform for her?


You're an elephant in the Cloak of Displacement.


How old are you, exactly?


Oh, well that'll totally--


Sure, I'd just like to point out that your mom said, "This guy's been bothering me a little," and we blew him up, and attacked him with tentacles.


I just take off straight for him.


I could certainly try.


I say, party on, Garthok. And then we leave.


Yeah. Then second strike. That's a natural 14, so I'm pretty sure that hits, plus seven, so 21. Ooh, that's an eight; it's the total other end of the spectrum. I keep getting there. Sorry, my brain is all over the place. 12 damage.


He won't. He likes us, right? You won't do it? Will you promise not to hurt us later?


I mean, we can try head back to Whitestone and get Grog healed up and check up on Scanlan.


Percy, you make me so nervous.


We got to go shopping or drinking or something, nothing serious for the love of Sarenrae.


Wait, do you double it because it's a critical?


Okay, okay, I'm going to check it. Oh, we don't pick a card.


I can inspire them. I mean...


He could have joined me.


Oh. Paper?


Where are we? What are our surroundings right now?


Yeah, what if somebody comes up to you and like, thinks you're somebody and you're not, and then you gotta, like, talk.


Wow. Wow. Two! That's four ones in a night.


Sorry, I was looking at necklaces.


We didn't know what her ship was about. Let's go downstairs. Maybe we can find something useful.


Oh, no. Okay. Cool.


Fucking shit!


She's restrained!


Him, okay, cool, I think we've got everything.


It is a little trick. Can you turn yourself into anything dangerous?


Commune in a commune.


Yeah, remember, it cracked and it was like, I'm coming for you! And we were like, we don't know what that means! And we ignored it.


I was going to say, will you come on our X-O Manowar show if we do one?


So we heard the song, but that's it. Good to know.


Of course!


Before we move forward, I've studied dragons a lot. I just want to say. So obviously we all know they're susceptible to fire damage, yes? This is an ice-breathing bastard. Do as much fire attacks as we can.


They're hidden from all the rest of our views, right?


Seriously, though, this is really painful, somebody should help him.


I was technically right below it.


Everything went great.


What if we were like, let's go after this guy, and then after that, we'll talk about being under contract? Like this can be a test situation.


Okay, thank you.


They said they were interested in 'the white one.' And I couldn't help but notice that you were turning quite a few heads when we were walking through town.


Is it Gilmore?


You would think, and I've been drinking it all night.


That is how you say it. TRAVIS. It's actually nah-jah.


We could have two guards.


Swapped at birth?


Irish, Laura.


At 3rd-level. How many have I used?


I'm a little shaky.


See you, guys.


Oh, my god, amazing.


I figured you would.


Matt, I take that back. I'm not going to cast Blur. Sorry, my apologies.


But what do you say to get the magic carpet?


Halved to seven?


Oh jeez louise. Okay, I'm going to move forward, back towards where I see Nila in there.


No, but it can do this. Can I do the thing?


Shit. 11.


What's it called?


Tonight. Caleb got that dodeca-fuckballs out of there by himself.


Are you looking to me to bend it. I was like, can you metalbend? This is awesome. But you want me to get my sweet hands on it?


Is it one in the middle and then one in the center of each wall?


Just behind him.


I'll let Yasha roll for hers.


I think they probably know we're here. I think they probably know we're coming. I think let's just trepidatiously make our way a little closer, see what else is in this town, see if maybe there's anything useful.


I have to wait to figure out when to open which one.


Vegan pizza? Are you kidding me?


Works for me.


Oh, death saves, handing out death saves.


Ja. Is there anything arcane in nature to the writing on the sides of it, or can I ascertain the purpose of it? This fountain.


I'm going to tilt the light into it and take a look down.


You made a good call.


Ooh! Okay. Am I close to her? Sorry, I can't see the map. You all look like little pixelated blocks.


Is there any burlap around?


What level are they?


All right, and that's eight points of damage.


Do you have to pray over your swords or anything this morning?


We got one stick.


We've been trying to prepare for your coming. Unfortunately, we don't have very much to make it appropriate.


Okay. I'm going to go for that hooded one if I can. I've got 25. Do I round down, because it's 45 halved?


Was that for everyone?


Not very long.


The guards are floating, following us.


It's the width that really does it.


Really? You mean it?


It's K'Varn!


Yeah, either that or I'm really bullshitting you and nothing happened.


Can't she run under his balls and--


Who's alive still? I'll inspire... shit, I'm failing.


Hear that?


As long as you don't hit the ship.


That's what I needed the extra gold for before I left.


I've had none! This place is just so hot.


This is what we do to crews on ships.


Thanks to that guy!


Just ask, just ask us and that would be fine, too.


Bye, Zeenoth! Zeenoth!


Open it up and just let your mind go and see what you think.


And say... Kord's strength be with you. And I smash the Titanstone Knuckles together.


Oh look at this thing!


In which of these rooms did that trap door open?


I hide behind Trinket, the smell of smoldering fur in my nose. As a bonus action, I will-- who's up next, who's coming soon? Is Percy next?


Church! (laughter)


Maybe we need all these stipulations. Whoever chugs a pint the quickest.


The bulb-- we've entered that chamber, right?


(stuttering) I walk to that shelf over there and are they free? Do the books come off the shelf even though they're locked?


Yeah, maybe we should be sneaky.


She is so cool! And she is so pretty! She's so cool.


He's using like a crowbar. Right?


She booped you. Nope.


I healed you, 18, which was actually low, but I rolled really high for each roll. That's my--


How do you poison a poisoned tree?


To be fair, he's saved our lives dozens of times.


What kind of festival? This is a winter festival?


What do you mean? Why were we the only ones with the tools?


Diamonds are forever.


Oh! Yes, how much would that be?


What do you sing?


(high-pitched) Ah!


A little humidity, yeah.


Oh gosh, I'm just so nervous about picking the 20. No. 19?


You be the leader. But do we have a deal?


I'm trying to change the moment that I said "Whitestone" into "Emon."


This is a rage spanking, right here.


Yeah, we paid a lot, yeah.


I don't know that. I aged but didn't know why.


They're about to invade.


I don't really get anything back on short rest.


Spell save DC. Top right.


Today, it's just one. We've already dropped one.


Sup?


Aww, yeah!


I punch him in the mouth.


But I lived in the north of that place.


Hey! Back in the game! Time for that later. You all right?


Guys, there's got to be like some street vendors. Come on.


But I'm on my own, right?


Well, if it was Bad News, yeah.


No, that's a 25 to hit.


Ugh, fuck that. No way!


I'll head back to Port Damali. There's other artifacts I need to find and destroy, but now I know that they can be. That's what I'm going to focus on.


Vax is here.


We're going to eat up? Fuck yeah.


I would like to announce that my father is hiding, six feet away from me, over there from my Skype window. He rolled very high in his stealth, and while he may not understand what my career is, he believes that I have one. (laughter)


They're all German tourists.


That's even worse.


We can go to Umbrasyl's lair, but it'll take an extra day, because I can only teleport us so many times.


Get him a giant glass of half Guinness, half whatever cider they have.


Laura and Sam did leave.


19. I don't get sleight of hand or anything?


Tonight? What time?


What's in those fields?


Ashley can read it out loud, if you want to.


Pick it.


All this time you've been trying to kick my teeth in and your real enemy is right over here.


That's another 40 feet.


A child's lightsaber toy thing.


Tasty gnome.


You'll hear a thump.


All I aim for in life.


How do we know what our AC is?


I've got nothing. (sighs)


Okay. I'm going to go after this buddy here. Are we flanking him, technically?


We go home. And we kill a dragon.


That!


Okay, I'm going to drop my elemental form--


Oh shit. Write that down, somebody?


This is war.


Sure. Me or you. Whoever feels more comfortable.


You're the cutest, Trinket.


Yes, I like that phrasing.


Give him a high-five. (laughter)


That's zero.


(Grog voice) It's a little brave, running around.


Well, the broom stopped flying.


And he picked a card. He got two Wishes.


(singing) Gern is my name and this is definitely the song that I'm singing.


I'll explain later!


P.O.V., two inches tall.


Don't worry, I'll help you my dear.


Goodnight boy-girls.


This, I'm sure you know, is really good.


That scimitar that the genie had, did it fall into the lava?


No! How about when we land?


So, you can't benefit from your equipment.


What was it? The Dawnfather, the Raven Queen, the Knowing Mistress, the Allhammer--


I know. We've been here before.


No? Did you have any friends? Ever?


Oh, with disadvantage.


Fair point. I lost my house today, all right? So go easy.


What did--


There it is, 16.


Oh, this guy. This guy is so drunk!


We go pick up some more snappers and poppers, poppers and snappers.


We're just going straight into the house?


Yeah. I'm going to ninja star for my main attack and if I can-- I don't know if I can-- I can't move on my bonus, can I?


I think it will be easier to get out of the Empire than back in.


Not so much.


I'm going to look at them and I am going to Command all four of them to attack each other. At fourth level.


Yeah, maybe not.


Oh, that's much better.


Oh, you're still up top.


His tiny mind is exactly proportionate for the rest of his body, Tiberius.


Black.


Matt just visited his mind palace.


Yeah, we can go down to the docks. Are there docks here?


Listen! I like to have all my options.


Yeah, that's in my body.


She's coming.


But plus ten!


Yes, of course. That's what it's there for. The back of it.


We could sell tickets.


Percival?


I am desperate, because we are still so fucked!


I was a little bit bad, but just a little.


As we're leaving, I say, that's a good look.


What? What the dice rolled?


Oh my god, it's so pretty.


I thought we weren't getting in a fight!


Tiberius jumped out the window and just cast Featherfall.


The only thing I have that can get us out fast is Plane Shift, which will get us out of the Feywild, but I brought that just in case.


I don't get that impression, do you?


Oh no, 12.


Well, that's even better.


Am I 12 damage?


I'm having a little regret that I didn't pack that Faerie Fire, man.


So we're totally getting in the tree, I know it, we're going to make it.


I gave your sister all my money. I did!


Who wants to read it? I can--


I'm going to move over here. Five, ten, 15.


Wow. This ain't your kids' D&D, right there!


Put him in the game so you can kill him.


Don't kill it.


Two days on horseback, or two days walking?


Oh, Jesus ballsacks. All right.


Okay. I feel like a good idea would be to just--


He's all right. He'll be fine. He's going to feel great when he wakes up.


Oh no, I use my Relentless Endurance to (singing).


Do we still have mist possibilities?


I said you were the leader.


What is wrong with you people?


Ever since I got to the city, I started using it, but people would abuse me, and my body for its, like, abilities. So until one day, I met Aes. He was kind, and he brought me into his family.


Did he just say dragons have really high perception so don't fuck with anything and make it look weird?


(shushes)


Of my Blood Maledict?


I'll do a religion check.


That's fine. I was spit-balling. I'm going to curl around the corner and I'm going to hold my turn for-- who's the last of us to go? I'm going to hold my turn for any spells that he casts, and I'm going to blast him three times the second he casts a spell on anybody. Right after a spell, I'm going to hit him.


Weren't you with us, Percy?


And I have my hand on Nott's shoulder, doing that thing.


Okay. I'm going to try some shit.


So I want to try to pick the three that I know. Two Abyssals and the Dwarven say entry. And I have advantage on.


Do, last question. Does the tree seem happier? What is the tree gonna do from here on out? What are you gonna do, tree?


I guess I'll shoot again. Yeah because I can't lift this thing, and I'm a wee thing.


No mercy for Percy.


Does it have any vulnerabilities?


Get the body off of you.


Yeah, that's what it was.


Not bad. 19?


Gallan, wake up!


Do we have any other weapons or any other special things?


Yeah. Grog, you try.


I'm pretty dex-y already.


As hungry as I am, I think we should wait to have Keyleth look at this fruit.


What is that? Oh, that's 26.


All right. You ready? Do you know what you're going to do up there?


I'm going to get a hot dog.


Are we still trying to keep one alive?


Yeah, that's more, I think, what we would need.


Simple. I like that.


He could be off of the tower, yes, and then it's all ranged attacks, that's what we have.


Heaving breasts.


Can we put the tarp back up and get under the tarp and see if we can see each other?


With advantage. 22.


There's only one other copy of that pillowcase, and it is mine. (laughter)


In some places it's dangerous. There's a place called The Trench that the Iron Shepherds in this area always hang out in.


20 gold is expensive. Wait, so if you could rescue your friends, or friend, or whatever--


I just heard that and I think it was Vax.


I'm still invisible.


Look, Scanlan. The necklace is really nice on the inside. I can vouch for it.


That doesn't count? I feel like it still counts, though. It's only 15.


I'm resistant to necrotic damage because of my blessing!


I'm not sure yet.


This big one?


That's some tiny-ass hooves.


How long has that been?


Well, they're not wrong.


Yeah-- wait, what?


Oh, little early.


I gave him as much information as I could.


And froze it, and everyone was like, "you can do that? You can't just roll dice and hit it?" And that's when we kind of understood oh, it's whatever the fuck you want.


But in the heat of the moment.


Ooh, yes. Well--


And then being stabbed by Scanlan.


What do we do this evening to prepare?


I think that's just what life is.


23, eff you.


Yeah. Oh! 19! That's much better. Plus 12, that's 32 to hit. And that's 15 points of damage, and head shot means he's got disadvantage on all attacks for the next round.


A giant werewolf eating an entire tree?


Typically.


He's got a little board under there.


(shouting) Energy! No? Okay.


One ring.


We know it's rich people that go there. We have to find a way to get you in.


Bob Loblaw.


That was close. Seven points of damage. So I get three back?


20. Is that also including myself?


Well, my history is shit, but 19.


I think I know how to pierce them. Lovely.


It won't happen for the rest of the game.


Should we walk around? The volcano, is it massive?


I'm a paladin with terrible religion skills. Blind faith.


Every week we're like, this is the episode where we start thinking. This is the one.


And not having Liam here, I'll just-- like that.


You were coming from work--


Yeah, with blood. Definitely with blood.


Sitting pretty.


Pike! Go upside down! (wookiee growl)


They're both pretty terrible. 16.


And if they've been watching, he just vanished. We should run now.


Oh wait, I get a bunch of weird shit, we're going to have to have a talk.


That's going to be a lot of movement.


Okay. But that one's peacing out? Do I still have an action?


Did you put in there that it had to be prompt? That it had to be prompt?


Terrible. Nine. 13 plus I'll take Fury of the Small, so that's 18.


Hello. Did you get your robe and everything and your slippers?


Yeah. And we could write a little something and say hello.


Now I'm adding the psychic damage.


Will that save us from the poison?


Well. Thank you. What now?


This fucker's got to be close to death, right?


How did Whitestone look?


Lowerdook.


Are we going to the Alcove or going to the treeline?


I can get you in. I can make you a fly, but I can't be invisible at the same time.


We're getting to the deep end!


I will follow.


Ornna, you have a lot of explaining to do!


Bryce from Alfield.


Okay, but nobody's hurt just yet. Spell bolsters allies with toughness and resolve.


Caleb? Caleb's doing okay.


And only you and you know how funny that is, because it's sealed in there.


Are we going to fight him now or are we going to try and run? Are we going to try and lure our way--


Did we make that sub goal?


The captain can be invisible. She might be in this room with us right now.


Travis, it's been nice playing with you.


Question. Can I switch to an animal form?


Now's good. Yeah, I'll be back after nightfall. Gonna go out for a bit.


Yeah, it was good!


We just killed one of them.


Oh, that smells really awful, I'm sorry.


Whoa! That is a very intense amount of damage for a tiny woman. Okay.


Eastward.


Do we recognize her?


Yeah. 12.


All right, I'm going to take out my sword and I'm going to attack it.


Initiative, Ashley, initiative.


Does anybody have magic? Can you see what these are?


Those that want to come can. I will understand if you want to sit this one out.


Hey, Vex, do you want any, like-- ale or anything? You-- I got some, like, firewater?


Special delivery for child's mum.


Go T-Mobile.


And that way, if he tries to run or do anything, I can futz with him.


Yeah, I have a superior.


What if we collapse the one in Whitestone?


Did you just take a dancer's tip?


Okay. (singing) Vex be nimble, Vex be quick! Vex jump under limbo stick! Now you don't know how you're going to react because Vex has an attack! Oi!


Beads, or beans, or bees?


Need you?


Kryn is the empress of the drow, you guys.


All right, let's go see Dad, then.


All of it, my master! All of the magic!


We had to hide at the other end of the building, man. That was nuts.


I am a healer! I'm a really good healer.


Oh, why didn't I get more points in that?


Okay, I'm ready.


Because our keep is butted up against the border of the city and everywhere else.


Anyone need the Potion of Speed?


I have Locate Object.


What worm? My worm?


Can you do it twice?


It's like getting punched with a motorcycle helmet on.


Yeah, this'll be good. Oh! Hey, 18!


I get it. So I'm going to hit again. 11.


Okay, well, yes. Rebuild our keep.


Tiberius, have you gone?


Click the boots. Hunter's Mark on mama. So all that's left is dagger, dagger, dagger, so I'm going to do sharpshooter throws with the three daggers that are left.


And I'm-- exhausted a little bit, little single tear as I think of my ancestors-- And that's it.


I somehow don't think so.


I'm going to have an aneurysm.


While we're waiting for them, can I pick up his longsword?


Technology, yeah!


It's one or multiple people.


That would be my staff.


I'll join.


And dust.


Well, if we're getting to Thar Amphala.


Vonn. Yonn?


But he bit me, right?


We're going to have to keep them busy.


Fjord, we need it. Really bad.


Eh. That's a-- oh! No! Wait, I keep forgetting that's a rogue skill. That's a 20.


Ow, that hurt my arm so bad.


I drag her out of the room and toward the steps.


Okay, let's go save our friends.


Then I will, bonus action, jump in that box-- (laughter)


Do you add anything to it?


Is that with advantage? Oh.


Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on, let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel the love.


It's like a deflated soccer ball, right?


Right, course you do. All right, bye.


Fucked up now.


We have to go up, right? Does it look like there's openings in the ceiling?


Technically, that would be a success.


Sad.


What a senseless waste of human life.


I'm just holding a bowling ball.


How large? Do you want to tell-- How large proportionally would you say the...? No? Okay, keep going.


Yeah, that'll hit, too.


Potentially.


Yeah, he might go into the pocket dimension.


I know, I know! I didn't think about it, damn it!


Great. We should be keeping an eye on the trees.


Can we see what's in it?


Yeah, subterranean bears, they have darkvision.


Can we insight and make sure that it's really who she--


This is Grog evolved.


You get one.


Yes! We'll meet you in Whitestone!


Oh my god, she's her own mob boss.


Well, Traveler, you heard it yourself! If you like everyone here, you can just show up anytime!


Are there any flowers that are even visible at this area?


Do I have to roll to blast through the doors?


Are you dextrous?


All right, what did I miss?


I was just wondering if I could ask you to ask them, to maybe help. I would never think to ask the gods for help if I wanted a shiny new sword or pile of riches, but this is something different.


Can everybody watching still at home give a round of applause for Darin?


Is anybody else startled by it?


It will take ten points of cold damage in return.


I gave my healer's kit to her, so there's nothing I can do to try and bring the girl back?


Yeah, I can.


So I can only do so much.


In the hole.


All right, I'm going.


I'm so excited for the art!


You be careful with them.


I know it did.


That's not-- That doesn't make anything better.


I think it's better, especially-- have we seen a tree that we can port to in case of an emergency? Or some sort of object that we can port to?


Fucking balls mother bitch, okay, wow.


He may finally have had enough.


You're not going to want to spend any of that in Shadycreek Run. There's nothing there for you.


Maybe just put it over top of that skull and keep it hidden for now.


Yeah, into the corridor.


So it has poison, right? It's poisoned me-- Oh, it has acid.


I dropped my travel mug.


The bear we left in the alley.


Why are you dealing drugs? Just be like boop!


Oh, is this a podcast now?


You guys are out in the open?


Well, this is good. This is a very valuable lesson. If you ever come across a purse like this again, you just take a tiny bit of it, and then leave the rest.


All right, do it. Mission Impossible.


A number of years? Well, in that case, they've probably gone stale by now. I would say 75 gold at the very best.


The box is empty! Was it worth it?


Is that chest ten feet away from me, as well?


Lodestone!


I give Vax a hug.


He did. He was a noble fellow. Having a bad day.


So it can emit a cry that shakes everything.


That's us. Always down for a scrap.


Are you down? Are you unconscious?


Yeah, probably should tell her.


You have a trammel, right, Pike?


So we're on the same level as them or are they above us?


Okay, all right, I can control the winds and give us forwards-facing winds for a solid hour if you want. You want it? You want a little, turn this into a speed boat? You know? See how fast it goes? I don't know what this means, I've just seen other sailors do it so.


As far as I'm concerned, you can drop dead in front of our faces right now, and it wouldn't be much different than the past 24 hours.


East of here.


I'll join Pike.


You can split up my take amongst them. I take it my obligation has been fulfilled?


Grog! Grog, can you hear us?


I'm going to walk in. Did it work?


Okay. Is that half my Constitution modifier?


Nine, ten, 11, 13. 17 for the second one. And then 14, 15, 16...


An ooze?


Let's just call it a hyphen for now.


I hug him. I hug him as hard as I've ever hugged Scanlan. I love you so much. You're my favorite person in the entire universe right now. I owe you--


Maybe you could just levitate Trinket behind?


And you can't blame someone for keeping things to themselves, so I'm not mad at him anymore for the things that he keeps to himself, because everybody's got their something, you know?


I've got two vials of underwater breathing.


I'm sorry, you guys. I'm so sorry.


Scanlan. Vex. We should disable the orbs, right?


So I've got two level threes left. With my Pearl of power.


Yeah. Life does need things to live. (laughter)


Yeah, that's kind of true.


So reduced to ten. I'm okay. I have four points left.


Have any what?


Get a lot of healing potions!


Oh, yeah, hold on. (foomp)


Funny is funny. He should have a better sense of humor.


Do we know what killed the tree?


I already have it. I already have it on my shoulder. It's too late. I'm writing it down.


Thank you, Grand Sire de Rolo, and if there's anything you ever need in return, all you have to do is ask.


Yes! Ugh.


There actually is a curse on our family. It's called diabetes. (laughter)


I'm curious about a couple things here.


He wants to see in the dark place.


(hoarse) Are we going to hold this up for when we go against the Briarwoods? I think it'll be confusing.


Thank you, Grog. That's a very fair point.


I can't see Algar, but Zsundie is the--


Her face looks angry.


Impressive.


I'll take the bag.


Just take your 80 points of damage, not your 160 points.


Come on, Vex. Come on. Do it for Trinket.


I'm perfectly content to just go down there, and if anyone asks we've just changed into something more comfortable.


I gotta heal up.


Wait, wait, wait. Are we--


So it is like oil.


Maybe-- we have one night. Maybe I could try and craft some sort of concussion explosive.


She got all the fucking way there? What did you do, Pike?


We'll do what we can.


Would three days be better than one, Percival?


Let me just reiterate, we always appreciated Scanlan.


So, what do you hope to accomplish at the end of completing all these tasks, you know, slaying a dragon? What do you want in the other end?


As I’m looking for Gilmore and Allura, I’m alerting the guards of the visuals of the assailants.


Where are we casting it upon?


No. I mean, I could, but it seems like a shitty use--


You guys have got seconds until that other guard comes back.


Your powers are worthless.


Oh, I can't even imagine Hotis disguised as Pike.


I also bend down and slap him a few times. (all laugh)


I think it's a chunnel, actually.


You come on to every human, orc, and half-elf in the entire kingdom, but pretending to be my wife for 30 minutes is too much.


3d8?!


Well yeah, fucking now.


Wait, did you give a d4 to everybody?


Is there a plate open or anything at the moment near me?


Great segue.


That's fine, but give me a second. We should make sure there's no tracks. We clear all the tracks away.


When they take their turn, they get 3d8 damage.


It's a dick.


Can I find Erwen?


Tara, so nice to meet you.


Can we do that now?


I might be out. I was about to say-- don't I have-- I might be out.


And it's cloudy, so I get how much more?


Do your holy shit when we go there, all right?


He doesn't need that. He's fine.


Rude.


Are you going to do the thing?


I know. Highly entertained.


Why is it called the Sun Tree?


360 points?


I'm going to slowly start making my way underneath everything, quietly and with--


I'm hitting my gem, too.


After getting hit by the water elemental, can I go, Hey! What do you want?


And that'll do me for the night.


And I start hitting the one in the center with my fucking stupid sword.


Paula Konito!


That's fucked up, Matt.


Then he can punch things.


You know the stones we talked about?


Wait, what's it called?


I just wasted one of my 2nd-levels y'all!


Yeah, pull him to the other side. They're seeing me do arcane bullshit on the side while sweating.


I did! I gave you my stone. My Transmutation Stone, which helps you resist cold.


I'm attempting.


Is she taking a step away from me?


We use fake shithead Grog. Sorry. Fake shitheadier Grog to create a scene and run off and draw away some of the goliaths, probably not Kevdak, and then you go in for the main event with a thinned-out Herd.


We know that there is something magical in the pool itself and then you said the long wooden box is glowing?


Get it, Altaïr.


You know memory is different than being able to tell the time of day by the sun, right?


So you know what? I'm going to (sings) Guiding Bolt the baby!


I mean, I'm okay if you are.


Jump off?


And I'm going to bamf there on it.


Can we loot the mist?


You can be a little vague with it. You don't have to be... I rolled very high.


I think Percy wants us to kiss, Pike.


Hey, it's okay, baby. It's okay.


Pull them up, Grog. Pull them up.


We still need to go talk to Earthbearer Groon and see what kind of lesson was there.


I don't know, I've got to crawl through!


Oh, well, wonderful! Tell him to follow our orders. That's all he needs to know for now.


That's not normal.


I don't know. But I'm still putting it on.


Hey, wait! That's my job!


For an hour?


I thought this was a formal trip.


What's this? Where is he?!


He's actually got a lot of hit points, really.


You need more iron in my diet.


We got one left, let's take it upstairs.


Wait-- (shushes)


Boring. Scanlan, you want to go in?


I think we can, actually.


Racism!


Tap that motherfucker!


I sense a little sarcasm in you, sir.


I still would like some help, maybe one extra hand.


To break a piece of the circle.


(whispers) And he's super interested in her.


It's got your poops right on it.


Literally, we're going to die from bad paperwork.


Ophelia Mardun.


I'm calling it swallow. On the way back, because we're obviously going to leave in the morning, to do stuff. I'd like to quickly stop at any blacksmith I see on the way back to Greyskull Keep.


And that's a 28.


Then I'm going to step right in front of Lady Briarwood and shield her with my body from Percy.


And just to make sure that my memory is on point--


OutdatedReference. "About to run my first session of D&D this Sunday. Thanks to you guys for the inspiration, so excited." (all cheer)


Hold your peace.


Let it rain!


Why don't we send someone first, or at least ask around before we just start swimming?


Yeah. Oh god. There's probably traps. Oh shit.


It's organic ash?


Better be.


It's worth a lot, and probably we'll be a little more careful about poking things separately.


I was only not shooting him to be polite.


No, we're on watch. We haven't seen anything, it's just a dream.


The tongue would be next.


Iron Shepherds.


I put my hand over Trixie, in my pocket.


I'm going to start going around and trying to mess up our tracks, maybe leave a few deeper footprints walking the other way?


I didn't know! Listen, I have my faults, for sure, but (stammers) I didn't know that you existed! I would have, I would have come to visit, I would have come to meet you-- how can you fault me for something that I did not know about?


I make sure Tary gets a little seashell crown. So.


You should be in front, and then the rest of us.


Wait, do you want-- Blessing of the Trickster!


We all watch.


Do we need to let the pixies know that we're going to do this?


Okay. I've gone since my last one, so I'll dodge.


So that's also on the to-do list, then.


You're pointing at me? I don't want perception, you want Beau.


Another 19.


Yes I will, I am very excited


"These pretzels are making me thirsty."


Why would I have to tell you?


I hate beholders so much.


No. Just, they're not real. A few steps back. Trickfoot's--


I'm still on the carpet!


I'm concerned-- I'm sorry, I'm confused. Tary. That was a Freudian slip. Why does your father think it's important to have brute strength and combat experience to run a business?


Keyleth! Do you have the Immovable Rod?


(hums) 17.


I did. I had a dream about it.


It's really pleasing in the hand, isn't it?


That's where the good stuff happens.


That's a really good idea.


You slick motherfucker.


Oh, did he take damage from me? Was my curse still in effect?


No, I'm fine. Fine. Rested. REM sleep is some of the best, so you know. I feel energized. Jazzed. Excited to continue on.


What abilities?


Are you two like an item?


Nein! Sorry.


Ew. We'll get there at night. That's all right though, it's early evening.


Okay. Yeah, so I'll Healing Word.


Up yours, Harryhausen!


Ulysses! Ulysses Stanneras!


She's vegan. Of course she told them.


Are we doing that now? Penis wiggle! (laughter)


Just diamonds.


(giggling) Purvan Pedobear.


(sighs) Well, the best laid plans....


I take out a holy oil vial out of the Bag of Holding, I crush it in my hand, and I take a swing at whatever he's holding.


Going to go find something that's a decent distance away from the three noble households, that has a reasonable view of the tree.


I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us right now.


They're even more powerful than I remember. I didn't even fucking know that Lorenzo could do that. You saw what he did, there's no way. It's fucked.


What has Delilah promised you? What do you gain out of this?


It was earlier I did it. They both hit; it was 20-something.


Not great damage  six damage.


That wasn't bad, I handled that. It was not a problem.


We're close to Gatshadow already?


Fifth attack.


Down here? Clarota, why? Why boats?


Maybe it's not there.


Tickle on his nose.


There's only one guy who ran up to her.


Hope you're wearing underwear, bitch, because he just looked up your skirt!


I'll do investigation.


I knew this day would come, I didn't think so soon, but--


Faerie Fire is an underused thing. It's really cool.


That was gnarly!


All right, Matt. Okay, so 11, 14, 20, 23, 25, 50. That's easy. 58, 60.


That's good, that's good. 29.


With advantage, that was cocked, though, was it?


That was also through my Blazing Bowstring.


Why are you hiding your face?


We learned a lot.


Don't they want to Counterspell that?


I also speak-- no, I speak Primordial. I keep getting that confused.


On the way, do we pass Packwearer's Provisions or any of the other fine establishments you've told us about?


With my third attack, I'd like to turn to his friend, grab him by the throat and go-- It's death, or target practice for my friends. Talk.


His ears are starting to droop!


When we went to my house, or, well, where I lived with Wilhand...


Yeah, I remember where that room was, so Frumpkin is taking a little fly around.


Man, I wish we would've a Fancy Feast.


Overall hit points.


30. Maxed out. Jeez.


Your imaginary character is also nauseous.


Can I use my Cloak of the Bat to fly up and then cast?


Your father is your father, how could you not be curious about your father?


This is a really bad time to do this because there's lots of people around. Can I do it at night? Is there less people at night? Would I have learned at least that much?


This is going to be a very complicated evening.


Children.


You smell better.


Wait, is magic not allowed within the city?


I got a shofar! I'm still saying we should rename the show Crate-ical Role for this month. I'm just saying.


And if they ask why there's nothing, we have a story, right? We're going to go pick up a shipment and bring it back.


All right. We'll leave the broom and see if it's still here.


That's if they see us.


Could you go look up that number for us, please?


I'm sure they already have.


Oh, should we hide? Can we try to hide?


Yeah, for sure.


Not great. Not great at all. Six.


14 for the first attack.


Okay. You really want to break into a prison?


How will we-- You and I could talk to the mouse.


I remember all of mine, I don't know.


Sylas is alive.


Minus?


As she's talking, I'm going to see if there's any sort of arcana or magical incantation on her, or any sort of possession. Is that something I can check for?


You can respond-- oh, you did.


If we're honoring Doty, I'd love to read to you the last thing that he wrote, well, transcribed before we went into the Hells.


If he survived the night.


And it gives me a greatsword melee attack.


He died as he lived  making the world a little bit wetter.


Hold that gun up from the ground.


For sure. (laughter)


So even if I've moved since I saw it last, I can still Dimension Door to where I think--?


Oh duh, okay. All right.


That's very temporary.


Yeah, but then we'll be able to recover a little bit and figure out what we're doing.


She'd have to do it 20 times.


I see your reasoning.


Great. I'll take my speed and rush at it.


Magazines.


Scanlan, grab some rags or something, wrap it around the blade. You're going to lift on your side; we're going to lift on this side.


That troll that I see.


Oh sorry, one last thing, Watchmaster. I pull out the book that I read about the nergaliid. Here this is a gift, for you. This is folklore. You will find I have marked a page in there. It will describe this thing.


I will full dash and get out of there, and turn left.


Did you use your tongues?


I always know which way north is, so let's go east.


Okay! I haven't done this in a while, so I'm falling back on an old crutch, an old beloved character-- Rhodey Slater is back to do another round--


You're blowing it!


All the ladies.


Comes in green and red, available in the Resident Evil universe.


I drop to my knees and I cast Locate Creature.


It was like a Pokémon, though.


I want to, if anything attacks us, I want to be able to attack it.


No, Nott, I need you here. Maybe give ourselves ten feet of distance between each other and fan out.


I take hold of the Jello head and press my head into it and say, thank you, sister.


Do I add anything?


If he takes you down and multi-attacks you, he could kill you. You healed her, right? She's conscious now.


That's a Frumpkin and a half.


Okay. Boy, oh boy. We're still trying to get that fucker up on the roof right?


Zahra sheds a tear, which freezes instantly on her face, and her internal flame melts it off.


They're not good people. They killed a lot of innocents.


All right. I've looked in the-- by the way, Matt-- I've looked in the thing. The--


I cast Fly on Trinket.


And I say, kiss our metaphorical hairy arses!


That's all I've got.


A couple hundred pounds?


This white dragon, does he bring weather, or any sort of change? It's all ice and snow, yeah?


Mending!


It's like the adult section for him.


You can tell that just from looking at him?


Yeah, this is just our viewing copy. There will be more details--


Let's go knock them over.
