Is Ballsack in there? When we walk in?


Perception? 16.


And I start running to the edge. Kima! Are you all right?


Grog, what do your elven eyes see?


Dunamis.


I might actually be the only tough one here. Shit.


How many names have you had?!


Oh, very well.


Passing the torch.


Wait, would you be on this council? And who would they be counseling? Is there no superior primate? Is there no, there's no--


Ah, that's complicated.


Maybe? I feel like it would have affected me in certain ways, or, you know, I just don't know!


Nogvurot is along the border.


Oh, this is embarrassing. 17, wait with intimidation, 19.


Man-made is not important.


Come, come. Do I recognize anyone in any of these tents?


Yeah. I go up to Vax. Palm over to him.


(laughs) Not yet.


A--


Divine Sense.


I agree. I'd like to find out what she knows about the third, and then maybe ask for a bit of respite before we continue. I actually do not feel very comfortable--


It could cost a lot of money.


We have a little bit of time. We can still do a little bit of casing, maybe go talk to the Gentleman and see what he has to offer in between.


I'll cuddle with the Doty arm.


All right, I walk back to the group. It's me and her later tonight.


Okay. Well, it was wonderful meeting you. Absolutely. Thank you. All right, bye. Okay, bye.


The fact that he's not a god gives me diarrhea feelings.


I have a lot of ideas.


You're making cocktails?


I think he had the hots for you.


Asmodeus, Bane the Strife Emperor, Tiamat--


It was so good!


Okay, I'm going to rocket toward the, hm. Just give me ten seconds to think.


Tiberius, these look like the crystals on your staff.


It's practically going to be in a safety deposit box.


22, 24.


I'll just eat one.


8d6 coming your way, papa.


We'll come in melee, just more-- closer to the stairs.


Get that bitch.


I might-- Oh.


They're not gonna find anything.


No, Lyra, no.


It's 7d6, right?


Are there heirloom tomatoes?


Half of its movement.


Raiders of the Lost Ark, we're just cutting through the jungle.


It comes back up and it paints a mustache on me, and I go: Arr!


Wait, did she give me any bonuses? No, right? Did you do your order of the totem thing?


Veth.


Nothing now, I don't think.


I hope that'll fucking hit. That is a 24?


Are you wanting me to talk about my life?


I need all my spell slots.


Desmond, dear?


Thank you. 1d10. (counting) 11 points.


We have to bring Ophelia to The Gentleman, right?


Guys. Blah-blah-blah-blah.


Is he right there?


#OrionAcaba.


Ah, I can't nominate Fjord?


Can I spend my tinkering check building a waffle iron? I'm just kidding. I'm kind of kidding. I'm going to put that aside for later.


Roll for random bar.


I don't know why I rolled both at the same time. 22 for me.


What if he gets even more charismatic and then he proposes again? And he charms you more?


All water here is hot.


All right. I'll try to trade my flask with that flask.


Treat him slightly better than you would treat a member of your own family.


I just said "coin." I didn't make it clear which kind of coin.


That’s not quite it.


I'm really sorry about that one time when you were talking about money with me, okay?


Oh! Joss Whedon up in this bitch!


It's not that nice.


Gives me the sense that this kid's going to be fine.


Oh. Acid. None of us have gotten hit yet.


Am I able to use Shield as a reaction if I've already cast a spell? No, correct? Because I've not tried to do that, so I don't know if it's allowed.


I healed myself last time just the amount of hit points I have right now.


But if it's permanent, why not do it tonight?


I'm not trying to rush faith. I'm just saying that Vecna has ascended to godhood. We have a limited amount of time to take him down. We need to speak with Kord.


8,000 gold.


Where did you get that chicken?


Are they selling or are they just setting up?


While he's figuring out his shit, if Trinket falls and I don't see him, does he still come into Raven's Slumber if it's within 100 feet? Or do I have to have visual?


You are too kind.


He tried to, I think, rob me? I thought, as a pirate, that I had immunity to that? I don't know, I'm just trying--


He's fine, just nothing even happened.


Punch me. I want to tell.


Oh, held!


Totally did.


I’m going to try and get to the side without the blade. I’m going to try and chop open one of the plates on the back. I’m going to start hacking away at it. Actually, even with the blades, there’s an open place right now? Is there a place for me to start poking the tender insides?


On my elemental?


So none of the shit around the edges, okay. I guess I will start studying the runes on the walls to see how they contribute to this mystery.


They're spiders.


I'm within 60 feet. I'm going to try to throw at the tome in his hand and I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger.


Wait, me too?


As we walk out, Keyleth throws a little gust cantrip to kick up the dust behind us. It just looks really dusty and epic as we walk off into the sunset.


The Pools of Wittebak.


Whoa, look at that carpet!


Oh, it's a concentration spell?


No, no. Listen. No, I am a guild member. On a technicality, but I am a guild member.


Let's hold off on the dog.


He's used all of his legendary resistances? Is that what that was?


I can't really see the layout of that rock, can I see through it? Is there an under that I can--


Yes. 100 percent. I start going to town on it.


To higher ground would be nice. Anywhere where we can see clearly.


Everybody's prone, and that gives me advantage on the attack as well, doesn't it?


Wait a minute.


But Levitate or something-- but we could tie a rope to you and it can--


It must have been terrible.


It was actually my mother.


So you take half damage.


There's Lego stuff!


'Cause you're doing arcana?


I grab my Spiritual Weapon as we're leaving and drag the giant lollipop out of the arena with me.


How was it from the lobby?


Who's on the shutting-off-those-doors duty? Is that a thing that we need to assign to someone?


Of the dragons? (laughter)


Yeah, suddenly I showed up and there's 30 yards of red velvet that I've been begging for.


We'll run into a lot of Common. Common is common for a reason.


Why don't you go with her?


Well, of course. If it was awkward, nobody wants that.


Also to point out, you did the full mo-cap for it. Not just the VO.


Kit's really talented.


But I've got winter coats that I bought for the group a long time ago.


The Sword of Kas. Okay.


Wouldst thou care to follow me inside?


Bangarang. Bangarang!


Fuck! We were doing so well.


Grog and the two gnomes will run south.


Not quite so much. It's only eight cubic feet.


I'm so nervous! Oh, Scanlan, come on!


Yes! We know you're lying! (all laugh)


What dice did you use?


Uncanny dodge.


"Ah sir, we're standing right here!"


It's all happening like this.


Later, of course. I go to my books.


Got it. I'll radio back up to the top and say: There are three mermen down here with dangerous weapons. I am very outnumbered. Please come quickly, you can reply to this message.


I have that armor.


Have a lovely afternoon.


Yes. I second this.


Good job, buddy! Little buddy!


Should we turn ourselves in?


Also I have a cat.


Now!


Yes, just be cautious, that's all we can do.


I give a hug.


Fine, I'm going to bean her in the head. Natural 20!


To do what? What is left? The dragons are dead. All that's left is Hotis. What is left?


They're helping me a lot right now.


Arms being chopped off. An axe to the face. I will illustrate being burned by fire.


Check the body for secrets.


This! Is! Bonertown!


Are none of us wearing the new shirt?


You got a fucking broom. I'm hopping on the broom.


Oh no, you're poisoned!


I'll tell you what. Why don't you guys get everything set to go, and I will drop this off.


Jude.


You can do Finger of Death this time.


I'm just going to walk to the cart, then.


Have you never seen an owl before?


"Ye olde."


I go in first.


No. All right, well--


A tragedy candle.


Yeah. Technically.


Oh my god. I'm going to have an ulcer after this game!


Yeah, that's good, that's good.


It's an old Druidish one?


-- and I open the Deck. I thought maybe you would like to draw a card.


There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled.


The braid's new. He decided to rock the braid. Go for it!


But it is very likely that we will be the thing that is dropped upon it from a great height, and the most cooperation we can get, getting into a position of power over this beast, the happier we'll all be.


Yes, she's number one.


As you know.


Well maybe that will make her like you more.


I go down to the wyverns and I start going for those stingers.


We'll be quiet, we'll just stay still and look around.


Now that I understand the--


The top of the tower is open and it continues through the middle?


(whispers) Grog rolled a six.


If you fucking get my broom lost because you told me not to go, I'm going to murder you. And this is not in character. This is me telling you that.


Oh, on which checks? Constitution.


Oh, I'm using my firbolg ability.


Oh. But she doesn't?


Where are you staying right now?


I'll stay outside.


I'm in the middle of this.


Heroes' Feast, man.


What did we just buy? We didn't buy superior?


Yes, it's been quite a while. I'm rather hungry.


(whispering) Memento.


Full HP.


It's okay. It's okay.


Graveyard has an attached temple, cemetery is just by itself.


You're shooting at the death knight?


23. Natural 20.


I'll do the signal.


Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! [record scratch]


Oh that's an icy hand grip, isn't it.


Okay. That's seven.


I think I saw that. Did you see that?


Okay. Not great.


So I'm lasting. What would I make, is it an insight check to decide if I thought Grog could make it across this thing?


So I did movement, I hid for my bonus, I have action-action as a paladin. And action.


Right, I know. I'm doing an elbow and a punch, I'm just holding my staff.


All right, I wander over to them. Hello.


Yeah, no, really.


It's not pretty.


It's so long, Matt!


Is there anybody else trained in arcana?


We're all healed.


Yeah, it's October, so we're doing Halloween. We're doing Hellboy, which I don't really know much about. I couldn't think of anybody who knew a lot about Hellboy. Do you know a lot about Hellboy?


C'mon, Pike! Lift that thing!


Do we have any spare glass vials?


We're carnival people, we've all got our issues. You don't end up here if you're not a little weird.


Yeah, but it's a big swamp. Are any of us good at like wood stuff? Is this me? Am I the girl?


All right. (sighs) I'm happy. I'm in love.


Tiberius, of course, would have a small dragonite or pseudodragon. Definitely.


All right, fuck it, now I just run, in a rage, I run into the lava and I start shoving him straight toward the flaming vagina hole.


And I'm going to mark all this off.


I'm gonna kind of lay back into it.


Well I guess I could have sent them while you were sleeping, I guess.


Damn it, Bobby.


The Sun Tree was here before the castle was here, but-- And things have always happened here. The city has a history of strange occurrences. I'm inclined to believe there was something-- Well, there was obviously something beneath the castle before she got here, or else she wouldn't have come here to begin with.


(kid voice) This a bear!


Or just the person, is he the only other one in range?


Dropping some dope beats.


Don't you have some ability that you can find magical objects?


Do what you have to.


Thunder.


Ah, 20.


And then he could keep the sword.


Yeah, that's what it means.


What are you getting at, Vax?


What is this, what do we have over here? Well, who was the old gnome that Grog saved in his intro video?


Yeah, like a lot.


Hot diggity.


It doesn't have to do it with all its heart.


What's up there?


Lootcrate!


Do you know how they were killed? Did anybody see any wounds?


He's a big fucking wolf.


Welcome back to college, man!


A. Ay. A. A.


No, I pull Scanlan aside.


Wash your hair when you can, that's fine.


I'm here to stay for as long as I can. It's very hard to stay in this form, especially when this place is very dark, and sometimes I just get pulled away, so I'm going to stay as long as I can.


Might have said it last game, but I don't remember it this game.


Gross, stop!


Now I climbed out of the hole to two gnolls. Hole to gnoll?


Is that as far as I can move right now?


We could just bolt. We're at the bottom of the valley.


On the one I just ran away from.


That's a Sneak Attack, because she's next to him. There's nothing in the rule book about stunned, or unconscious, or anything.


And I'm out.


Yeah, I feel like you did this before.


Heal? I'm maxed.


Really? Was it?


Does Dottie drink anything?


Anybody have any neck tattoos that look like serpents?


It feels like it went away. It did not! You just forgot about it, it's back with Damion Poitier. He's awesome. He was Thanos, the first Thanos before he got replaced because celebrities are dicks. And--


Did you spit on my thing--


Right, so I turn to Scanlan. And I say you and I are mates, right?


What's that mean, what's that mean?


I want to go see Kaylie, I guess, if she's around. Are we hanging out together, or are we breaking off?


Those guides that you made, the sailing guides. [laughter]


I'm holding three tomes, correct?


Let's put the tar bucket in the haversack of holding, if that's possible. If it will fit.


For one minute, they can add a d4 to a saving throw.


I mean, an hour in, yeah, but we were in the rain for like, 48 hours.


Eight hours, right? It lasts eight hours?


Wait, wait. What? (all laugh)


Yeah. How long did you have Do-oh-ty?


I go in and stand at the walls next to the door.


Kind of? Something that nobody understands yet that I should probably explain to people at some point.


He's getting slushied in the face.


We're all trying some shit, it's okay.


I kiss him back through the blood. (groaning)


Sorry, 13.


I like this idea. It's a little crazy, but I like it.


Second one. That'll hit. 23.


Oh god. Doogie Howser, eat your fucking heart out.


(whispers) You've got to go.


That could be nice. Yeah.


Someone get a camera on this guy.


Are there stairs? Oh, we're in a room. Let's go out the room. What could happen?


We're just staring out the door down at her.


(sighs) All right.


(mumbles) You have advantage.


Yes. Yes.


Trinket stays awake with you, though.


I don't want to see the giant fist of Scanlan.


How far are we from 10K?


Bonus action to hide.


I was just going to ask  are the walls stone or chiseled-out rock?


Percy, you're in slow-mo! You're slow-mo, Percy!


Yeah! I was going to say, you sound like them, I love it!


Yeah, I've been looking in the little mirror, trying to get the height right.


So it's true; he wasn't just trying to guilt me.


Well, what does it mean? What could it mean?!


Yeah. And we have 40,000 more gold coming. That's four days of entities--


Because he's a cleaner!


Hey! Orn, chill!


I've lost my druid die!


That's nice of you. You could just go (whoosh) and cross them off.


Speak with Animals.


Yes, you drop their speed to zero!


Dragonborn is a lot of talk.


Oh man, I love you guys.


Spooky exit.


Why did you take that?


Do we see the sail? Does it have any markings on it?


Us four.


Yes, we will tell you about the basilisks.


Night time, right? Sun has gone down?


And then I'm going to kick off and get on my broom, so I'm off the ground.


d20!


Oh, okay. All right.


I think Lockheed is good enough.


Uriel has been corrupted once already.


6th-level gone, 7th-level gone. Ready.


It's a little homework and a little bit magic trick. This is where I keep my spells. This is my book. And this is the piece of luck that you helped me achieve in Trostenwald. Over the months and years, I gather the amount of magic tricks that I can do. So in this book, for instance, there is a new spell that I do not even know how to use myself where I can make an invisible helper. What is going to happen now, I bought supplies for it-- I find a booth for us in the corner-- is I am going to move it from here into here and I thought you could help me. Would you like to do that?


And in New Jersey.


Yes, yeah, this is coming along great.


Which is inside of you.


Prepped for the future and forgot to do what I wanted to do.


Just let it happen.


(high-pitched) Automatic win!


I can't do much else. Do I have any movement?


We got our Davy Jones in the room, he'll take care of the dwarves.


Ugh! What if she was a good guy?


I rolled a natural 20 to attack with my hand crossbow.


We go. Very quickly. Bolt over to the cart.


That was cocked.


Atlas Obscura that shit.


Fucking Spice Girls.


I just want to get a closer look at the circle.


We could totally do a Brady Bunch.


I'm going to drop my form, take my action to cast Earthbind on him, it's a 300-foot range spell.


-- take my quill.


Will the Bag of Holding work down here?


It's morning-time now.


Your secret is safe with me.


Hold on. I send Frumpkin into the sky. Look down, and see if now that I have him flying closer, maybe I can see better, or see something moving in this dim light, before it goes?


You are that. You are that. He has a way about him, you have to admit.


Everybody roll for initiative


I did share meals with this person for two straight years. Never mind. I'm walking away.


What, for us to lure Raishan-slash-Thordak to?


It's a 20 on the floor!


Do it, it's fine. We're just starting.


Locked off, chained? Does this alley have a lot of human traffic or are we on our own?


The big bad of campaign two.


Near an island of glass.


But there's four seasons? Or is it three seasons up here? I don't know.


Ah ha!


Am I, like, on top of it?


Oh, for another full movement.


I am well aware that I killed a person. I have nothing else to say, why is everyone looking at me?


No, I disagree.


It makes me nervous. I don't know why other than it looks big and fucking scary. I thought about talking to him myself but he will just kick me in the goolies, so I thought that I would tell you, because I think he would listen to you, he certainly would--


Sic 'em.


He's like, "No money was spent!"


Impress me.


Got to pick a lock first, or check the door.


You're so talented and amazing.


All right. I'm going to try and fix this broken piece of gosa.


Can we look at Clarota and say "Do you know anything about this?"


You are a brave little fellow.


So we're facing another door.


Plausible deniability.


The only important thing on that paper.


Let's kill the fish people.


Look, we're all fuck-ups. We like people who show their vulnerabilities.


At a time like this?


There's a big centipede-y human, creepy creature that's killed a lot of things and we should probably avoid that at all costs.


I think we might be doing this now, so be prepared for it.


Okay. And they're like a hundred feet away?


Honestly, better than I expected.


Yeah, what does it say?


It was a different Beau.


Balan! Balan was so nice!


Do we need to be standing in front of the symbol that it lines up with?


Oh. Nine.


They don't get on, do they?


No, but we don't know if she has or not. They've got their necks on the line. I know they're not to be trusted, but they're in a precarious position, as well.


Yeah, I'm going eagle.


Sounds good to me.


Lesson learned, and I'll use the rest of my action to get up on the back.


I scrabble back and squish in with Nott at the front of the boat.


(laughs) Oh jeez. Oh no.


You know what? He can sleep outside, don't worry. Don't worry about the bear.


Hits! Don't even bother; I'm unconscious.


It's like those birds that hit our windows at home.


I'm sorry to disturb you, your name is of great repute around these parts.


But I wanted I wanted to do this to his head. Okay, whatever works.


What's our ploy if this thing tries to kill us?


I fucking hate these things!


I like it a lot.


That's so mean. (all laugh)


It's the Gabon. Gabon?


Okay. I'm probably more than 40 feet away from the druid?


I'm going to take a Grasping Vine and choke her around her throat.


We should move now, right?


Can I look down and say, "Hello, muppet." And I would like to rage. (all laugh)


The pit fiend?


They're dressed for an occasion. Fuck it. Just go.


All right. I just thought, it did fantastic things before! I don't know why it doesn't like me so much.


Do I knock down the doorway a little bit more?


Jesus, sucking it up today.


I'm involved in this. This is exciting.


I'm already excited by this.


No, but I feel like you have.


Two please.


She does see hamster unicorns. Are they gods?


That's already better.


Can I look over at Lady Briarwood and do a check on her to see if she looks stable?


Three syllables. We're being invaded by dingbats.


I'm going to jump in the hole.


(whispers) Sorry! Sorry!


Here's one gold. I just wanted to fire her up.


I'm walking with a smile, looking very friendly.


-- and I say, you won't pee on me will you? I've already been marked.


That doesn't make any sense at all.


That's fine. I've been getting a little wrapped up in this team; we're working as a team, and I've forgotten you and me. I've forgotten.


Ja I mutter a few words and suddenly look like an old coot with a band of hair around the sides and my jaw is off to the side a bit and it's missing a few teeth and very squinty. That's me.


60 seconds late, ladies and gentlemen.


Who's taking Kiri?


No, we're going to Draconia.


Yeah. Yeah, so don't worry.


Oh wow.


I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne.


I swear to you. We're all coming out of here alive.


I can plant these trees anywhere. Just need solid ground.


I lost you at like the third word.


"Dear Sam, just signed up for a Master-level subscription at D&D Beyond, and all their content is so cool! I'm enclosing a photo of a tattoo I just got; it's my first and I'm very proud, as you can see. That's Nott and Mollymauk dancing together. I know it's in cursive, so you might not be able to read that they're both saying, 'We're going to live forever!' What do you think?" There was a picture included in that one.


Remove them both.


Just concentrate for a moment and see what she's doing.


I guess the rest of them are on the rug?


Right? Am I right? So Signal Boost is back! It never went away, you didn't realize that, but it's back. (laughter)


The pool water?


Is he regenerating himself?


What the hell was he thinking?


Okay. (giggles) Spell attack. 16?


That goliath went on quite the ride. Down the crevasse, up 100 feet, down, down again.


I don't want to sell it. I just want to have it. It's pink.


Male tees.


I feel like-- could you give him the book?


How deep does it look?


Yes. I want to cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone.


Or do you want to talk to him blue?


There's no sign of anybody who used to be here? Nothing of value, nothing of interest?


Now we really need to do it.


Pike, should I do something or no?


Wait, wait. (counting) Yeah, 15.


What are we running from?


I'm going to whisper to Scanlan. I'm going to say, I'm going to stay back. You go ahead.


That's much better than those other numbers that you were saying.


I almost forgot we tied that on! That was funny. Man, we were drunk.


Are we returning the band?


Just a quick aside, while all of this is going on. I place the thing in my lap and I pick up the skull. Oh, so many secrets, huh, Yorick? (gravelly) "Maybe you should tear it off your chest." I don't think that's a good idea. "It's driving you crazy." Maybe not yet. "It's probably a good idea." You're funny.


Is this like one of those, like a parfait? What's it called?


Do you know anyone where that's their little side hobby?


Peace on--


There's a chance. She said that this temple that we're about to visit was one of three.


We don't know. Let me take a look at that belt, maybe. Wait, you have to be trained in arcana to identify something, don't you?


What, by who?


Totally 'Little Rascals' it! Oh, I love it!


Didn't mean to summon you, Scalebearer, I know your time is precious.


Somebody might slip--


Fassbender. (laughter)


It's still going.


Yeah, just a backhand.


After Liam had asked the DM.


That's very sweet. Uh. Emotion. I would like it if Pike was here.


We'll be cautious, and we'll have you to protect us.


How are things with the old man?


No! Somebody could use it.


I would assume I'm in the middle.


You have destroyed dragons, tree men, hearts...


Pay attention, ranger.


I'll go up and see what I see. Just above us, not far away.


Could I purchase, say, 200 gold worth of it?


Are you a member of the Hand?


Thank you, Shaun-slash-Matt.


Nobody else is grappled right now.


The windlass!


It's wonderful, it's a little morbid and wonderful at the same time.


(messy eating noises)


I'm going to use Luck again.


Are we being stealthy?


Vanity, you say?


100 gold.


Ah, come on.


You can finish your game though, I'll just watch.


"I turn someone into a chicken."


I will freeze and slowly turn to the sound.


50 gold. Wow, I got to work on my fucking memory. Great, I will take a healing potion and the enchantment transfer, please.


Do you still have advantage on death saving throws because of that thing that we did a while back? Or is that long gone? Never mind. Carry on.


I have something called Divine Intervention.


Well, if I do Alter Self--


I think we could draw out their worst very easily. Hmm. How committed are your people to trial by combat?


It's cocked on a 20.


I shouldn't text my apology?


If Scanlan and one of the others does Lightning at the same time and it goes through that line, we could drop them all at once.


You've already gone back?


Nope, I just need to know it's her.


Should I go dart after him?


I start to tilt his head and I'm like showing us won't work, we need a location.


Eh, it's whatever.


But look. (slashing noise) I mean, look.


That's Ben-gay.


Follow our orders.


Bear-man. Man-bear.


Word. I'm still a person. I'm gonna go ahead and also do a call lighting spell. Bam, call lightning right on its head. 'Cause he's wet.


We have to find Grog!


All right, go quickly.


I'll form the head.


I bent my paper. (high voice) 17!


Forgot about that. (laughter)


Rolled high.


Can you transform anymore or are you spent?


Reckless attack.


And then six because this is doubled.


We need to have breakfast.


(whispering) Yes. Yes, Percival.


Okay, so you disappeared?


Are you going to handle Lorenzo? Who's going to handle Lorenzo? (shouting) Who's going to handle Lorenzo? Fuck! I'm going to jump over the horses' asses and get to Lorenzo.


I don't have any idea. I don't know.


It's just me changing the words to contemporary songs, but making them about Dungeons & Dragons, and I'll grow my hair like Weird Al.


Some people are vulnerable and looking for answers.


Yeah, I'm really here.


I'm 38!


I find a little patch of dust and do a little dust bath real quick and then I'm going to use one of my books of stuffs and start researching liches just because I want to.


On Vex's suggestion, I'm going to make an investigation check. 30.


Moment of confusion-- here it is, right here, where I left it. Nobody has tampered with it. I turn around and I pull back my clothing and show a huge slash across my body, and say: You see this? It was done by this thing. (whoosh)


Stairway to Heaven!


It's right here; it's at eye level with me.


All right, we're on our way. Pike, come on.


Did you find a ledger? Is that what you found?


And you lose all your gold.


(murmurs) I was just wondering if it would happen.


Oh, you're welcome so much! How old are you? What's your name?


Okay. I'm going to run over behind Frumpkin, in that little alcove. Actually, that's a lie. I'm going to go next to Caleb.


I'm gonna cast Tree Stride on myself.


6 big hit points.


I'm proud of you.


We spent almost 50,000 dollars on our keep.


Run, Coral, run!


Well, you've met the couple that do.


I'm complimenting you.


We got a stern warning as we left.


Do you want me to go get Deuce?


And how many are in the herd, roughly?


Kiki? Is that what you called her when she was your wife?


Oh my god, you guys are amazing. I only have one request.


Everyone get -


No, we were filming this ridiculous television series called Hell Town when I was a kid. It was awful.


I'm going to try to distract.


We'll bring him up to speed later.


Okay. 19.


Yeah, that is the key  if I want to. No, perhaps Beauregard is fleet of foot. She could round you out.


From Lady Briarwood, yeah.


And move in front of the rest of the group. I put my back to the rest of the group.


You said perception?


You get the wish, Grog, you sure get the wish.


Travis has a job, another job.


Wait, no damage, it took?


Do you think that with the time that's passed, Cassandra has found any of the belongings of the Briarwoods? They were pretty snazzy.


Okay. Is there any stray furniture around?


We're not happy yet.


Throat punch!


What are you looking at?


Whatever, you possessed Voldemort.


Let's get out of here. Take a walk, we're going to take a walk.


Did we go to the docks?


Stamp punch.


I'm okay, it was just wood.


Clarota is pretty good.


Trinket! Wake up!


Try to stealth it. Are we camouflaging the carpet?


You didn't shit yourself, so you're a winner.


Maybe he's coming to thank you! Maybe!


Can't we?


We appreciate your time.


Yeah. 15.


Syldor, we have killed two of these dragons already. Nothing could please me more to hear that you are amassing forces here to go back; that is possibly the greatest thing I've ever heard you say to me.


And I want to throw his remnants back onto our dance floor.


It didn't go through the entire floor, I don't think.


I was doing a lot of work. (laughter)


Nice. That completes my turn.


Be honest.


Slip-and-slide?


You want to send her after your friend?


That has to happen if we hit 3k.


It's not special to her in any way?


I do! I do! They're necessary all the time. All the time! Except when it comes--


Now what I want you to do is imagine an hourglass. You got that? Good picture of an hourglass in your heads? See all that sand draining out? Let's get a move on.


The Sun Tree was angry. It may have taken revenge.


Scanlan, only with the boots.


Do you think maybe that you could maybe start out on a journey with us, and then head back if you need to get back to the temple?


I like it, it's cozy.


Yeah. I'm back to zero.


But my room is just the way I want it.


Thanks, so did you.


Is this one?


Did the Hex actually take, then? Wouldn't I have noticed?


Oh, you're doing Trinket, right.


Would that make your actual eyeballs burn?


If they came there, they would've been provoked, I figured.


I think you're going to give us everything on your cart.


Yes. Am I within 60 feet--


The sculpture of myself makes me pretty emotional, too. (all laugh)


I've only ever seen people like thieves, like my brother, do things like you've done. Can you teach me anything that you know to help me maybe be a little more stealthy, as well?


Oh, she's 'quite special' to you, yeah?


I swim over to the edge of the tower to try and lean up against the side of it. Make myself less obvious out in the open water.


Oh. I don't have stats, I'm a bear.


By the way, this is Grog.


Let's stand over top of where it is.


I'll Mage Hand check for traps.


But today, it became too much.


I'm going to walk up behind him--


(shouting) Displacer Beasts!


He was heading west, right?


No, actually.


Yasha, I saw you asking about that book the lady had.


Oh, I got you. Shit, I don't remember what it was when I picked it up.


Yeah! (whispering) We got the stuff.


Ooh, ooh, fire, fire!


Oh, it is? Oh shit. Awesome. 26.


If you knock yourself unconscious with your own fireball?


The horn was from Orcus. He's not a demigod.


And I love you for it.


I mean, Barry! Barry's exclusive.


Oh yeah, that actually would be good.


(chuckles) Do they have a branch here?


All right, nice, Pike!


Probably Portal, Portal or Dragon Age.


He does! He's got his bulette armor, man. He's a cannonball. What am I doing? A strength?


Nott's going to poke her head into the window where Beau is inside. Beau is within a few feet of a baddie, right? I'm going to shoot the baddie next to Beau. 15.


Sorry, we were confused. Sorry.


There still begs the question of, is someone else going to come looking for this? Now that the Plank King--


Oh, I'm just-- big strides. Big strides!


I don't know, everyone just keeps talking about it.


Bequeathed to you.


Taliesin hates pot!


Yes, I did. My old stomping grounds.


Come back, Ashley!


(softly) Fuck. All right, I will-- shit. I don't care about the fucking erinyes thing. If I take a lightning shot at the pit fiend, will I hit Vax?


You never went to brothels or anything like that then, I guess.


I sense a lot coming out from the tree, that's clear, can I sense an energy going in towards the tree?


I want to see if I can find the source of the bog muck.


We're going to mist it?


Okay. I see what it means.


I figured we'd all be moving outside, at least.


More than it was.


Can I do anything about that?


Hey, man, it's my bag of tricks, all right?


I'm going to try to do another grapple.


I don't know. Okay, take me down--


Oh my god, Scanlan, run.


You are standing before me, talking to me. You did.


What Lego did you get?


Is it pretty?


His, yeah, his people. "Back the fuck off from my people", yeah.


Does she still have chocolate all over her face?


So I get one more question?


I got something!


Hey, what's up?


Mm-hmm. So for my next shot, I'm going to burn a point. I wonder if a leg-wing shot would do anything here. All right, I'm going to burn a grit, and I'm not going to do Sharpshooter. I'm just going to take a shot. And that's 24 to hit?


We act now.


Oh, some of those are good.


It's sprung. We have to pick it up.


Yeah, so you're at advantage because of your size and all of your attacks have an additional 1d4.


Does that oversee ones? Because I've been counting ones as ones for a long time.


Pleasant day!


So it went the way we came.


Roll a d20, and add your religion.


Not great.


I'm going to come back and join you.


If you miss though, the ground is covered in water, so the powder will get really wet.


Chod can't use that, can he?


Have you been hit?


No, he's not. I saw his balls. I saw his golden balls.


Hanging over the table.


How did I just immediately forget that's what we were doing?


The hottest penguin I ever saw.


Maybe we should all go.


We are sorry that this cannot end as quickly as would be agreeable. We can do our best to help make you comfortable, and if you need some proof of the power that we wield, we can offer a token. I have a thought. But if you wish, a token of our power.


He pulls out of his waistband-- (all laugh)


I think so, Pike. I think at this point, we should just move forward.


It's hard.


Perhaps this girl Toya is his baby's bottle, and then once in a while he wants an extra snack.


To Kraghammer?


17 for the first one.


(imitates flute) --stinks.


d4, that's right.


Well! (laughter)


You're going on a ride!


They're the worst.


We should go watch Grog fight.


Nice. And 19 again!


Not for friends.


Whoa! What happened? I mean, I know what happened. Fuck.


Don't think they don't know our names now.


Oh, unlock, okay. So that's a 22.


Okay. Is there any cover? Are there chimneys? Is there anything I can duck behind?


Are there any other crossbolt-y things?


Anything from The Ruby of the Sea, maybe?


(whispering) Fuck me.


That wasn’t much of a discount, Gilmore.


Had a Two-Face.


Come on, Gil. Three. (all laugh)


I'm sure it's nothing. Probably nothing. Just leave it.


I recommend that you allow me to check for magical problems. Then once we know what's what, then you go in. But that takes about ten minutes.


What's my distance? Is this Pepperbox distance or Bad News distance, at the moment?


Cannonballs?


Well, we need to peel this like an onion. We need to, I believe, get some help. Get some reassurance. Outer layer of the onion is making sure we take whoever is on the walls, whoever is keeping watch, out, silently, so that we can begin anew with the building itself. I think that either you or my friend here should go in ahead of us so we have some idea of what is happening. Once in a while I turn this one into a spider. It is slow, but it is very undetectable.


Athletics? Hmm. Not good. 12!


No, only if it's elemental damage. Eight, 16, 17 plus six.


I'm nervous.


No, but not much better. Eight.


Who would stay there right? I mean--


We'll bring tents, we're going to bring some nice tents.


I really, really like this thing.


I feel good about my investigation, I have a keen eye.


Hey, we're all friends here.


Wait, join the rebellion or ride around town telling everyone, "quell?"


Okay. In that direction?


I think this whole damn town-- I think the whole land is cursed. Is what I think.


I'm pretty sure they can see into the Ethereal Plane, with Truesight. But that's only the archdevils who might have it, but it is illusory magic, I'm pretty sure.


I walk him out.


Yeah, right in the middle, like the Bruce Willis cut. Okay.


We have wine.


Les Paul.


800?


(whispered) That's good. That's good.


Take a break. Run away upstate, for the summertime.


You'll never know.


He doesn't mind it.


(gasp) Natural 20!


Matador it.


Ooh, 22.


I think we'll do that.


I just wanted you to know.


Get a room, guys!


Yeah, as long as you stay close to me. It moves with me.


The break room is open to all, but from 9 00 to 11:00 in the morning, Max uses it to poop. We have a code system for reserving the makeup room, so no one walks in. If you're breastfeeding, hang a sock on the door. If you're waxing Sam Riegel's chest hair, you hang a bandana on the door, and if you're having sex, leave the door open because that's kinky. Travis, we reinforced your chair to accommodate your baby weight.


No. He's part of the team.


If he brought his father back to fight underneath him.


Yes, it is, because Grog's right there.


Just nail a sock on the side of it, it'll be great. (laughter)


So it would have evened out.


I already have a ruby. I'm fine.


Didn't you say that they would send someone to the room?


Fatty lives!


Okay! (all laugh)


What about the goddess Ioun? The goddess of knowledge? Would she have known?


Come on, you got it.


First one is a 33.


All right-- ooh, and it's sneak--


It's halves and halvsies, you know?


No, not good.


You said minus 38, right?


Wait, you're going in?


Sorry, I didn't mean to read all that and make it not interesting.


I try to break free.


That's cool. I want to gauge it right over Keg's shoulders and throw two darts.


Come on, one. (mutters) 19.


Holy fuck!


Do we roll initiative, too? We're re-rolling initiative, the three of us?


Okay, I run up and take the Mace of Disruption, which also has the holy oil on it, which fights against undead! So I take it and I go (ffff) right underneath.


Of course. Thanks for the armor. What does it look like? (laughter)


Right. I'm just letting you know the prerequisites so you can ask the right questions. Just go.


I'm just trying to think ahead.


Our jaws are just--


Sure, we walk back to the guards and I show them the key. Can we get in?


He's already metal.


Maybe it's a secret entrance to something!


Let's say I hit him, he looks back, and he's looking at my nipples.


Yeah, and then the one, the guy that we just killed in front of the --


Yeah, it's out there.


Not unlike a raven taking flight.


Oh dear. Head back. We're going to have that meeting soon. Get your game face on, yeah?


All right, Vax pulls it over and starts filling it out and says, all right, but you know, we're kind of a big deal here--


I break from Vax's grasp and start running back


Not yet!


Plus I had a one on the first one.


All risk. That's what this is! We are doing all risk!


No! It has to be here somewhere!


There is an undead thing, maybe one undead guy got stuck in the middle.


Five dragons swoop down. (laughter)


Isn't your Hex still up from the last game, too?


I have almost that much.


Famous last words.


I would also like to drag Father Reynal out of his room and put him at the pedestal.


What is this?! What is this?! What the fuck?!


You could do a regular arrow.


Well, that's much different.


We'll have a conversation about what she was trying to do off-camera so I can have a better understanding of it.


Yeah, come on, Vex.


Scanlan and I flew over there.


Well, it's too late. Constitution saving throw?


Wait, so you're lying again.


Hang on, hold the phone. Hold the phone.


Well, he can be on a roof.


Okay, maybe she doesn't worship the Traveler.


Are you still unclear about whether we should kill this dragon or not? We have a killing machine now!


I run and skip right up next to my sister and I have a potion of superior healing and I pour it into Keyleth's mouth.


(laughter) That's fair.


Fudge. I'm going to do something dumb. Don't leave a man behind.


There was one of each color.


It is at an angle.


Well, you can get within 60 feet of me so just move toward--


(quietly) We all got above ten?


Oh, you do?


All right. I'll hit him with the sword of Kas. Reckless. That's a critical. That was a 19. I'm not used to hitting on those. Oh shit.


How tall is he? Is his head touching the ceiling?


Really? Hey, Avantika. How many dudes you think you killed?


Did the light just change in here?


Okay, I'm hiding in the room.


Oh yeah, what kind of dwarf? A lady dwarf?


Does Frumpkin hear anyone?


Yeah, it's Museldorf Musketeers--


Very much like a worg, if you will.


No, he likes you a lot, I can tell.


Just out of 30 feet.


You are checking the bodies for things, right?


Did you just say fart the son act?


One of them's missing, but I think it fell out of the--


She dropped it in a portapotty.


Give out 32,000 books a year.


Trees and vines.


Can I use perception to make sure that we're really private right now?


Yeah, I take off my earpiece, too.


Burn it to the ground.


19-- oh, so the 2d6 was nine, plus five is--


Oh, shit. That's right. It's a 60 foot range. How far can I get it? That's true. Oh, I guess I can run forward first before I do it. I'm going to run forward and try to get up on that tree.


You just left us?


There's still a mind flayer.


Tapping into my background a little bit, I'm going to go: You know, I used to utilize the sewers back in the day. Real good to stay out of sight. Move stuff quickly.


We have a green room?


Caduceus, grab my feet, just in case.


I'll send the perceptive fuckers up to the crow's nest.


Do we fly in, Tiberius? And just go...


Can I help at all? Can I assist? Can I hold her utensils for her?


If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times. I don't need help.


I'm right in front of you. I'm talking about--


Well, that'll work then.


Oh, you've all seen an owl before, shut up!


Good for you! I did too, just barely. It was a bad day for me, Kiri.


Maybe hold her neck. Make sure it goes down.


I will let you flick me hard, hard in the nads, should we survive.


Noted. I walk away


Let's make it a magic three.


I was sitting on the couch.


So do your damage again because that--


But there's fish men and possibly fish women right down there that could come out and kill us in our sleep.


Yeah, I rolled a four.


Oh thank you, brother.


Somebody has to be telling them things.


This is the end of her. I will be there to see it.


I'm a little curious--


(whispering) I'm going to die.


Don't you think the thing that the big thing is guarding is the better path?


So if we were to take that 50 and possibly spend it on something in this shop, is there anything that we should take a look at?


What, you really got to go?


Yeah. (dagger noises) Okay.


You are more sensitive than I would have imagined.


Or any of us.


Yeah, we should explore this idea, but maybe.


17 points, with three lightning damage.


We could do that, sure, I guess.


I'm grappled and stunned.


So many elves.


From the doorway to the mirror, is it less than 60 feet?


Is it the Pearl of Power?


I immediately grab my purse and hold onto it.


Yes, she is.


Five points of damage to him!


You said wrapped up? Or just the ones in the river were wrapped up?


We were so glad to be here.


You're just a Negative Nancy.


That didn't go as well as I had hoped.


Oh, good. Don't do that, please.


Oh shit. Well, poo.


Great. I don't want be in here anymore.


I'm honestly still kind of into the earthquake idea. Bringing down the tower. I'm not going to lie.


Who's inside the mansion?


Oh my god, we're so terrible!


Okay, I'm going to cast it at 4th-level.


Through the water?


We should remind everyone you are immune to poison, you are immune to cursed, you've got a bonus on wisdom saving throws, and plus 1d10 temporary hitpoints.


Can we tell the people as they come out, I know you'll want to celebrate, but please keep it as quiet as possible tonight. We don't know when it could be back.


I was trying to flank around.


Yeah, like maybe she knows if there are more spheres and how to find them, if they're in the temple.


No, what was the second word you said?


So what did you roll?


He's taking a picture


Eight! Like I said, everything looks good!


How long has he been gone for?


No, but they've got-- Don't they have beaks, like a squid?


Let's continue.


Maybe wait for them to land.


Flying-man.


Yes, I'll take the crystal as well. Is that the only thing-- the rest are all tarnished and green, yes?


No, let's get out of here. They wouldn't build a huge bronze trap room within their castle. No, they've lived here in peace for five years. What would they need this for? This has some sort of use for their magic. This is not a trap room.


No, you're not the only one. I don't trust that shit.


Yep, just regular. Can I use my bonus action to go into a frenzied rage because I have never been swallowed? And I don't like it.


(suppressing a sneeze)


(mock-crying) Is it Thursday yet?


Garthok!


Oh man, Jester and I talked about everything. Like, everything. About childhood, favorite kind of ice cream. We know everything about each other now.


It's not great. Nine.


Why don't we use-- okay, here's the thing. If we start with Spiritual Weapon, we lure their gaze to this side of the area and then if this beautiful young lady could find her way around the other side to free the two--


Is the door opening behind her?


I place my hands on her shoulders--


Is their head height about the same height as the seal and the crossbeams?


You just wait.


You dicks.


Yes, she is. It grows on you, though.


Concrete shoes!


I had a question.


It's a five-by-five square. Do we see anything amiss? Oh, that's terrible. 24.


Okay. So that's what I was using, the element of what I did.


We want to fight.


Hey! There's a tunnel down there!


(French accent) How do you know anything about these boys? How did you get them?


I'm in double digits, which is uncomfortable for me.


Okay, I'm going to walk forward as far as I can, like here? Can I get here?


You guys, there's no traps. We should head towards this darkened room.


Okay. We might have to wait a little bit.


It goes without saying that Keg is aroused.


As Taryon, can't we teleport to wherever we're trying to go?


You got your bow.


He's within 60 feet of me?


I'm just trying to find out how much I actually owe you.


Free food and drinks?


Sundry Square, during the day.


It's fine. We'll ask on our way out. It's good.


How do we get around? What do we do?


Tiffany can be invisible though, you guys.


You're in a tourist town; things are going to cost something.


Thanks for all those greater than three's, guys.


We're going to ground this ship. We're going straight into the beach and we're going to run our asses into the fucking jungle.


We're talking about the mind, I think.


A name is earned. Yes.


Then it could be a little chilly!


No, I don't think so either. They're fucking ceramic pottery pieces.


Thank you very much, Beau. Thank you. Sometimes I need to leave. Plus, I barely know you guys.


I can't read the words.


What do you mean, same color as the swamp? Green and shitty?


That's 11 points right there.


Go where?


I go back to the door and just be like--


I would've done what Scanlan would always do. I would've won and killed you. I mean, I'm super powerful and awesome.


Frisbee  "Thank you for letting us share your adventures. It means a lot to us too."


Garthok is waiting for us down in those, so we can go look at the Clasp and talk to them and everything, because he's told them we're on our way.


They impacted?


I don't have the head. I only have the gross bear tattoo off Kevdak.


There's a lot of dead bodies on the ground, man.


It's a-- What saving throw? I'm so sorry.


Yeah. Oh Grog. I heard it happen.


You see, Scanlan, you've had this particular piece for over ten, let's say, matches or weeks. You have used it zero times. In over six battles, over the same course, using it zero times. (laughter)


But I also will admit, I kind of want to see the pixies.


Can I make it great weapon master, please?


This is--


Yes, please! Oh! I bought a Hellboy comic today! Another black compendium book to go with my other big black blades on my shelf.


That's your threshold crest. Piece of a threshold crest.


Oh, I feel so guilty right now!


But one, I can?


Ooh, a little pennant. My son will love that, big fan of the movie.


Eloquence personified.


Sir Starbucks, yes.


Earthbreaker Groon. Arbiter Brom. Ben Klauss.


That's right. Y'all thought Keyleth was a fuck-up. What am I doing, just a straight attack?


Oh, and that's two crits, which means I get two grits back. I'm like (grunts) that way.


Also, technically wouldn't my beetles get a bonus action anyway, or?


I will be on Mulligan soon, and I like red and white, blue and black, and all the colors of the rainbow.


In the tour?


There is no way that the guy who's currently got a knife stuck in her isn't going to get some of this.


Just one, because it's all black walnut.


It's fine, Beau.


Pretty sure she did it.


Wait! I didn't roll yet.


As my movement, I'm going to-- where am I?


We will find her mate, he who is not named.


On the biggest one. This one.


So as a group we can all try to move forward, but as we get closer to him--


I don't give a fuck what Vex did.


Here's what I can do. I can start breaking the well, or I can start blocking entrances. I can start pulling down--


I am out of money. I have a teeny bit left. But I also bought some other things.


But really nice, you said?


We can't leave her, the swamp things will kill it.


Oh, yes. It is not stinky, though. You may smell it, if you wish.


I don't know. We've gone back and forth on it!


Shit! Bad rolls. 17 total.


(loudly) Are you buying drugs? (laughter)


Well, they said all hold hands.


Ooh. What do you do, take the best two? What do you do?


I regret nothing.


I communicate all of that to everybody. Caduceus, you were talking about some--


Oh! That's so great!


Misses. Just misses.


Distillery? I pull the gun away.


That's exactly what I was thinking.


For now, anyway. And then when we free this place, we can find a proper tomb for him.


Being as the man's daughter is standing here with us, perhaps we will pass on that idea.


So if we aim at that area that doesn't have scales...


I'm glad that's you.


Can you give the Seeker an inspiration before he goes on an adventure?


He was eating something. I don't think it was him, but it looked like he was eating--


20, we don't pick a card.


They came fully stocked. Look at that. Look at how jealous Laura is. Look at that. It fuels me. I love it.


No. I'm the oldest.


Not really my area of expertise, but 22. History check, correct?


Ow ow ow ow.


Don't stop in the tree, you will create terrible congestion.


Not good. Don't do it.


Oh, how generous of you.


How does this work?


Oh my god, he's still alive?


I go out and I do a Skywrite in the sky again.


No, but seriously, could she be evil? Seriously.


I'll go down one, just a little ways, and then I'll come back.


I've got a hold. And I respect that if you think that I'm slipping, you'll let me know.


We need that big brain on our side?


What’s that, how much?


No, we were more small-time thieves. We wouldn't typically hijack moving caravans. Usually we'd wait until they parked somewhere and then just go sneak on and steal something out of the back.


I'm sending Frumpkin now, okay?


Roll my damage.


Still in his spot?


I can't. I blew all my natural energies doing that Sunbeam.


So exotic.


Plus my persuasion of zero, because I have a shitty charisma.


Hate, greed, pride, any of the seven deadly sins.


Eagle.


The plan was perfect.


Great, thank you. I'm going to sling a dagger at the orc right in front of those two bears.


I think it'll give you wings so you can fly.


We've been dealing some pretty good damage.


Not becoming a catchphrase.


Ionos is another name mentioned in the letter.


Okay. Roll high. I did not. Ten.


Blimey.


Shakäste, did you say something about making all this better than what it was?


Hey guys, it's me. I'm in a box!


Wouldn't it be funny if there was, like, two copper and a bunch of bird seed?


And we learned that it does something, too.


He's very persuasive. Actually, Scanlan, will you come with me also?


I'm leaving her behind.


Yeah, that's an 11.


Sure, I've got like a hundred of them.


I think it's dead.


Just like you, Molly!


A little cold.


(whispers) Oh my god, you guys, I'm in!


The Meat Man does not hug.


Five gnolls. We've got these guys.


Just out of pity's sake. I'm disappointed I came back up to one hit point.


I love my new stats.


I completely ungracefully take it off and throw it at you. Give me that armor. How is this going to fit me? I'm just naked trying to squirm into these extra-skinny jeans.


You do that.


Healing Word is such dog shit, as far as what it can do.


To them?


I love you, guys!


I say, (chants) you ugly, you ugly, yo mama says you ugly! And I cast Vicious Mockery. (laughter)


Shit balls.


I was going to say, sorry for being a pain in the ass. It takes a lot for me to sacrifice all my people when a fourth of us have already been sacrificed.


Let's get back.


Can't you make all of us invisible?


Did an airship ever arrive?


Now we're getting silly.


I am going to grab the rope, and I am literally just going to jump off the side and I'm going to fling her up.


There's nothing better than waking up in the morning with no pants and flowers in your hair.


Table one.


No. Can you put it in a vial?


(hacking spit) I don't remember how I said it before.


Aren't there four dragons?


You can trust me.


I don't get along with anybody.


I feel like you're putting words in my mouth.


Yes! Our winner for the Espionage Bath Bombs Tabletop from @espionagemakeup goes to (drumroll) Danny Carr. Who is @Eleine35. So, Danny, I'm pretty sure you follow me on Twitter, just PM me your address and I'll get these out to you. And thank you!


Oh! If we live.


You could do invisible and I could fly as fast as I fucking can away.


What if, due to some strange third-arm syndrome, I can't wear t-shirts; is there any way I can show my support to the show?


Grog, maybe you should hold it then because we're not as strong as you.


Yeah, they've got portraits up, we get to see them when the feed's up.


1d10 plus eight. Oh, it's my monk level plus my proficiency bonus, so no damage.


It just keeps curving and curving?


Good thinking, Lyra.


Where did everybody go?


I'm more of a fan of them coming to us, frankly.


18 plus eight. 26.


I'm going to take the jug. I'm going to put some of the dragon blood that's drying out in the jug and swirl it around a little bit.


Even if it's super-duper dark?


Not making a sound.


You fucking arsehole.


This was a great plan!


Is that what it is?


Cool. Hey. Hey. Oh, sorry.


We'll prod that.


Did you merge 8 Mile with--


That was a natural 20.


It seems you have powerful items.


A barrel of books!


She's awake, but very low.


No, not exactly.


Oremid Hass.


It's very nice armor.


And you need more than a hundred. But she has plenty left over. Percy and Sam need more than a hundred.


To hit. And that's ten plus three points of ice damage.


Three points? Okay, so--


Well, I know that I'm a goblin. For as long as I've been alive, I haven't felt comfortable in my skin for as long as I can remember. I just feel like I shouldn't be-- I don't fit in with them. It's not just that. This feels wrong, like I should be in a different body. The way they act, and the way they are. It's just not me. They do horrible things to people, and they seem fine with it, but I don't know. I never felt the same as them. It's not that I don't like myself or anything; I think I'm okay. But I just don't like how I feel when I see my hands or my feet. They just feel wrong. I want to be different.


Okay. So there's Osysa's mate.


Advantage for half-elf, advantage for feast.


We can all sleep in the same bedroom and you can put your wire thingy in front of it, and then we'll know if anyone tries to break in.


See, this is why I shouldn't have this many dice, because I don't know what to choose. Okay. 21.


No duh, and now I'm going to watch 21 Jump Street on that brand new TV network, Fox! Richard Grieco is bodacious!


D&D Beyond, available now exclusively at Sharper Image, Sam Goody, Circuit City, Tower Records, Comp USA and Crazy Eddie. (laughter)


This thing doesn't take extra damage from this does it?


Keyleth is right next to me, right?


Just avoid the pit!


Put the stank on this guy.


11 plus eight.


Also very popular.


I touch Vax's shoulder and I cast Enhance Ability and I'm going to give you dex saves-- what do you want?


What are dollars?


That's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me.


Your one-inch cube suddenly grows.


Wait, did you drop a bunch of gold on them?


Make sure you grab your dignity as well.


Could you pour some Crisco out of that magic jug of yours and lube up?


20 Sneak Attack damage. Thanks, Matt.


Is that the name of the town?


Yeah, she said for all of us to hear that the real reward comes from releasing the serpent. Is that your intentions? Is that what you desire?


I know, fuck! I throw it and hopefully get it to go right in his mouth as he's trying to have a comeback. And I'll just look bewildered that it worked.


Let's see here, how can I kill them? Kill them all at once. Kill them one at a time. Kill them in an embarrassing way.


Eight hit points.


Did you wake up to people, or alone?


You're super fast. Remember, you're super fast.


Shaft.


Wait! I wanted to talk to him. You've got to wait. (laughter)


All right. All right, one more time. I'll do some like Black Sabbathy sort of (heavy metal screaming).


She did. We hit it off. And I asked her if the werewolves were just in the Feywild. Turns out--


Well, there is no sneak attack-- oh yeah, yeah. I meant that the critical was on the second one. That's what I meant.


Come on, Sarenrae.


Come on. Thank god I didn't do that too weird. That's 20.


Okay, how do we do that? In broad daylight.


They're not exactly--


You've got this, Mr. Clay.


That's how it's spelled  Key-leth.


So that's behind us.


Ja. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.


Roll a two.


What if he's alive and in peril, do we tell her that? We're going to lose our only employee.


Fuck my life. I know! 21!


Dexterity, huh?


I still have one more Control Water spell I can do.


Pretty fancy technological speak.


Jester, high-five.


We have our crew. We do not need them.


Poetic justice!


Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?


DM? What would will-- is that wisdom?


Ironkeeper what?


I can't do this alone and I-- To answer your question from yesterday, I think the problem of this Aramente is that it shows you the components of what you need to be a leader, but being a leader could take a lifetime to master. If you even can master such a thing. So lots still to go, this isn't the end.


Last question. The final question.


I smile the whole time. Bring it.


You didn't see any creature or anything?


I can do the false terrain--


It is. It is.


We've been too used to being careful.


Oh, does he get an attack of opportunity on you because you fly by?


We still have people in the lockup.


I would also like a donut, please.


I forgot I have advantage on strength checks when I'm raging.


Oh, to make s'mores? That's a great idea.


I get that piece of chalk and in thieves' cant I'm going to write on the wall: Much appreciated, Uriel sends his regards, V.


Wow, good call back.


Beyond actual, personal stationery. I think the notion would be is that you would actually send your actual handwriting in something like this because that way they would know that it was you. You would be very careful how and who you would send that through. You wouldn't want a second person taking dictation as you plotted to overthrow the government.


We had a vague idea.


He was the guy who saved us! He saved us when the white dragon came to Westruun.


No, I don't. Instead, I Polymorph into a fly, and I'm going to fly my way to the throne room.


I lean down and say, does it look like somewhere that we can rest for the night?


Ah yes, it's been quite an interesting two years.


I'm looking down at us.


That's okay. We're all going to die.


Oh, that's true, the Hunk of Quall. I pull out the Hunk of Quall.


Don't see us too soon. I mean, whenever you're near us, you both almost die. So maybe just--


And you let it know we're here! (chuckles)


I trust that you are all here in the service of justice and maybe friendship. But I'm not. I'm here for revenge. And as much as I would like to believe otherwise, I know that's not true. And I think I need people here who are not here for revenge. I don't know how to stop this.


Right down there.


It looked really good in my sketchbook.


Need more packs.


That was not during the show.


This is also good. That's 28 points of normal damage, five points of psychic and three points of necrotic.


You have a bunch of them.


There's like two of me.


We love you, too. Thank you for everything. If you want us to fight her, just say jenga, and we will.


I'll need a bit more later. Thanks.


I'm a big thing. A 20 is what I rolled. I rolled a 19 plus one, so I'm going to do an acrobatics run.


Utterly pickable! It's the most pickable lock I've ever seen!


Get it out of your system now, because when we get over there you should probably keep your voice down.


Was anything more to be gleaned from reading the entire thing?


I'll look over his shoulder and help look. I'm going to help look.


Oh! We have another gem. Hit it!


Taliesin, there's tabaxis coming out of every stall. What the hell, man?


As prisoners. They're humans, they're disgusting, filthy pink skins.


Kick us off strong!


Okay. I'm going to hop off the broom.


I'm going to try to tell the trees to stop.


No, yes, he seems like he would have been had he hadn't--


Quit tip-toeing into the ocean, let's run into this.


Ooh, yeah. Yeah, that's ten.


Yeah. Vax sees that and is not worried. (laughter)


I am asking Mollymauk.


He's safe over there?


Oh, that frickin' sound. Do we-- I can try to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, if we want to sneak through here.


But, since the Yasha thing?


Verily, verily.


I'm also currently wearing a Headband of Initiative, which I'd forgotten about.


That's my fucking opal dice again. Asshole. Oh look, and that was 18.


I've got vegemite written down.


We'll find another way to alert them. Send out the dog. I don't know.


Did you get my messages?


It's ten.


I can't do any, don't I have a bonus action?


Aw, buddy! You're okay!


On the last guy. Yeah, and I draw it towards us.


You went British again.


I went northern, western, southern. That is right, right?


Can you draw them? What do they say?


Aw, that's cocked. Okay, ten points of damage.


You're getting an owl?


You realize that I was born to shove things in holes.


And you're covered in wings.


Well, I've asked Beau to check me and I'll check her on areas of aggression. If I start controlling the oceans and shit, maybe we'll talk about it.


You'll watch what you say about her.


Our plan was okay.


As they all leave, Beau peeks her head out of the grass and goes: I knocked one unconscious, and I don't know what to do with him now. I could've let him go, but I didn't want to say anything in front of everybody because I started feeling bad once you guys felt bad.


Give it to Fjord, he'll touch anything!


I do a little bit of Druidcraft, something like lightning bugs in the room, and make them dance. Nice and calming, just trying to get back to sleep.


(Dwarven accent) Whoa. What happened to all the other little dwarves?


Not from her perspective. (laughter)


I think the child will be dead by the morning.


You've got a good eye, yes.


I thought we were at 30 --


I like that you made an enlarged figure for Grog.


Scanlan, are you all right around these goblin corpses?


Yeah, I think so too. You're awfully quiet.


I use my bonus action to reload and stare at the nice person below me.


Because it's this fucking town. It's fucked. No offense. It won't be fucked soon.


Past the tatas.


A round of Trosts for both our tables, please.


Yeah, I've been practicing one technique! It's called wearing this ring of water walking! (laughter)


As long as they'll let us do this, we're going to do it.


Is it a dead end? So it's a wall in front of you.


I took that shot specifically to see where she was sitting and see where we were sitting with her.


I'm going to keep this spyglass.


All right. I'll step ahead and go invisible.


"This is the greatest job ever".


I'm going to make a Spiritual Weapon.


You're not here?


The first night is rough!


I don't know why I keep volunteering for fucking perception. 14.


Too stiff for you?


All of us. All of us. Do you want to go find the rest?


The thing I imagine most adventurers have. A little coin satchel.


Is it a two-handed weapon? Single-handed?


We must kill this elephant.


Yeah, let's see, I should move forward.


A quick pitch would be really good.


No. Glass is specifically how you contain acid.


I'm going to be a gentleman and not throw up from the speed at which one goes in that direction.


It was so dirty. The Whispered One! I have a memory! I don't know where I learned of this knowledge-- I am very old-- but I did, at some point in my travels, I remember reading about something. A lich king?


Yeah, hold on, she's naked! Do you want to get it? Or should I get it?


Maybe a hit point.


A wedding. And our anniversary is tomorrow. (cheering)


Well-earned.


Nailed it!


Yeah, sans shit. And we're out.


Yeah, right there. I'll move my Hex to him. I'm going to bust out the Bad News rifle, I'm going to sit, and I'm going to take a nice, calm, calculated sharpshooter shot at him.


And they're demons, right?


It's pretty exciting.


I'm at one point of health.


Ho ho ho. (laughter)


I have a 13.


It is. It's a Valve golden ticket. She's giving it away at 1:30 on Monday, so make sure to tune in for that. It's the only way to own Half-Life 3, maybe.


Do we? How much money do we have?


Let's take a long walk around the house to see if there's a way in through the back.


That wasn't his turn?


Okay. I just make eye contact with him and I mentally tell him that he really has the urge to try to do a headstand. Lay down his weapon and he really just wants to see if he can do it. (laughter)


It's my turn?!


No Divine--


Uh. Let's find out. (all laugh)


What? It moves into the fireplace?


I think six hours is about what it takes.


Thorbir, you want the taint? There's tons of magic in it. (laughter)


Uh-huh. Goodbye--


Don't think of it as a thing that evens out, think of it as an ever-increasing debt that doesn't really ever get paid.


Your bear shat like a fountain. Wasn't solid. I don't know what you're feeding him. It was a little runny, sorry. Roughage. He needs roughage.


In the barely hundreds.


Yeah, maybe the other side of the tunnel so they don't see you.


There's a row of duergar around the corner, they're all in a line like Radio City, we just-- if I can get-- Scanlan, if you-- what about you, Keyleth? Do I remember light-- or do you bring it down from above? Tiberius.


Tumblers?


That's biblical.


Sam's here!


No, not him. Sylas? No, not Sylas! Seeker Asum?


I'll be with Percy, more up front.


With the warning system, we'll have plenty of time to get away if there's too many of them and they'll have no way up if we pull the rope up.


Yeah, it made my cheeks really red.


One month ago you needed that.


It worked, yeah. With Caduceus' Bane we got it. It almost didn't make it, but with Bane it made it.


Boulder-Parchment-Shears?


If you go up by the funeral pyres, where we set the trap, you'll find him.


Black Lotus.


We have time for principles immediately afterwards, when we come back.


Ooh, get 'em!


Did you say claws?


It was almost a one, but it wasn't. That's pretty good. It's 19.


They roll disadvantage against you, too.


Yeah, that's it!


I lean in and say, Are we whispering now? We whispering again?


Well, this is every six seconds so I could just stand here for a minute going (whoosh whoosh whoosh) and not get close.


We're going to try to get my sister first.


(louder) Can you make the mist go away?


Is there a new rug?


Can I bend down and, covering with my vest a little bit, see if I can search and figure out exactly what these things are made out of?


Here. No, there.


He makes a wisdom saving throw.


Does anyone have a better plan? Is this what we're going with?


They didn't Man-E-Faces around? I'm misremembering that? Maybe I just really like Man-E-Faces.


Oh shit. Is this a thing where you think you're invited to a party, so you bring your whole crew and then maybe realize they weren't invited?


How long were we gone? Do you have any rough estimate?


Not necessarily bipedal.


All right, so I'm going to go talk to Vex. An expert in dragons I hope?


Maybe she'll lend it to me.


Yeah, I'd like to see it, but I guess I'm not in a terrible rush.


I'm not taking off my mask.


We're fine!


What are you talking about? None of us did anything. None of us! We protected the people of this town!


From the bar  it seems very doubtful. Excuse me.


We're badasses now.


We're doing great. Beau, you're going to join me as we pull alongside the ship.


I want to steal something. I have the itch. It's back.


Should I do the skull?


Excuse me. I just inhaled my own spit.


She's not going to come with us until we've killed this K'Varn.


Well, tell him Vax'ildan and friends visited. We're in the city for a week.


(gasps) Perfect!


I'm going over there.


That's good! Chip her down!


We're also only playing for three hours, as opposed to eight.


Natural 20? I don't want to hear it!


(snarls) These fucking things.


Wait, where are we going? Marrowway Cove? What?


The guards posted at our door, do they have guns or just like knives and stuff?


Are we spooning?


Yeah. Definitely already. 17.


At least be good at it if you're going to do that.


The stones. We hope that you will inform Vorugal that it's going to happen. He'll head over, fight-fight-fight. He becomes much weaker, we jump in, fight-fight-fight.


My tail's gone! Bummer.


Thanks for watching us shop!


(laughter)


It's a little early, maybe.


I saw an 8 and I was adding shit! 11, sorry, 11.


Can I find that in here?


That was still really cool.


I don't even know your last name!


Yeah. I'm sorry.


Started on the bottom, now we're here.


You can do it once a day forever, you have it for the rest of your life.


I stop.


It's done.


So it could burn the metal?


I want to scratch behind his ears.


I'm at advantage, though, so I just roll one.


Ah, yes! I put a fancy robe around Kima's stone statue.


Lean it up against the table.


(shouts) Just make conversation.


He's getting the cork.


Mixed lies or half-truths.


(rapidly knocking)


Yeah. Keyleth can get us anywhere when we need.


What purse?


Okay. Am I-- can it see me in its eye? Would I be in its thingy?


I'm going to assume that I'm okay then.


It's so hot in here, though.


Ooh. Oh, wait, that's better than I thought. It's 19. I'm wearing my thing, my hood. Do I get to roll again for stealth?


Like a bowl or a bowl?


I start going back to the chamber and I'll do the spell again.


I'll take the left.


I'm going to scoot around to that side.


(pitiful noise of a throwing star flying uselessly through water)


You own boat shoes.


(tearfully) That's true.


Shush!


I try the door.


Sick.


Nonagon.


You can see through to the other side!


This is a crazy thing above us.


I'm taking it.


Superiority.


They stole our thunder!


Yeah, I'll try and levitate down a bit.


So I rolled a 15.


You're welcome, but how come you never told us about Dr. Dranzel? Did you forget about him?


I just got it! I just got it when I leveled.


No, I just want to breathe in the cold.


This is a sneak attack?


I'm not giving them to you! I'm going to look at them with you.


Son of a bitch, we overslept.


Oh, no, yeah, I totally hear what you're saying. We're going for a ride, bitch. And I back up.


You know, I wouldn't go west, maybe.


You gave Vex'ahlia a title in your Whitestone kingdom. She was the Duchess of some hut.


Well, because I'm kind of in trouble in Nicodranas.


I try to find Caleb. They do that.


It's a trip attack.


You've seen me turn into an eagle.


I am a centimeter away from real death.


Strange that you would say that.


Not yet. I'm actually going to spend a grit to gain my advantage back.


Did you live in this?


Okay, so short rest--


Just distract them, please.


Yes! That's awesome.


Ooh, that's terrible. 13.


I've got the boots, so I was going to use my boots.


I can hear you, but your lips aren't moving. This is-- nope, it's not working for me. Nope. Probably take ten minutes actually trying to do that before we get going.


I go to the bar.


Let's get halfway up the tower.


Pike saved you. Pike brought you back.


That's a layered question.


I am Vex.


That's coming to my house. It's going to my house, right there.


Very high for the third.


(cracks up)


I've got ten more feet of movement? (laughing) Okay, I'm going to try to get away from her. I'm going to go--


I am basically holding ready to shoot a bolt at anything that moves, and I was actually hanging a little bit far down just in case one of them drops, I can heal, and somewhere where I'm not going to get attacked by kelp and I'm keeping very aware.


Is anyone following us? Can we do a quick check around and just see?


Did you add your spell attack bonus?


Hold my antlers! Yeah, that's good. 19.


Are there any buildings that have enough structure to them where it feels like there might be things inside that have been relatively unmolested at this point?


Do you make babies still?


Oh, that's between you and her. I'm not taking armor off of her.


How much time is it going to take them to get the gold?


I would like to jump down from the wall and run as fast as I can after the leader and the cart.


I will find you.


Percy's seen some shit.


Oh no. Keyleth's been day-drinking and night-drinking.


Towards the Shademirk.


I'm a painter.


He had a bird-like thing in the face.


She meant the doctor's office.


Your Highness, what is your problem?


So that's like a grown-- almost grown goblin.


Sent a request?! You're using other people? I trust you, I don't trust other people!


Good shopping run. Where did you get 13 gold?


What are we looking at from our vantage point?


You know what we could do, Vex'ahlia, we could go about 200 feet away from the hut and you could just--fink!--and see what it does and then we'll shift out of there.


You also have inspiration if you need it.


Station wagon. Facing backwards.


I cast Speak with Animals on them and I constantly try to communicate with him.


That's tomorrow night.


I mean, just in case there's maybe some ancient deity that rules over the forest of Herethis and some sort of goddess? Fuck it, let's go.


No, he can't. He's done with his wings.


There's a window.


Sure, but will you be watching me or no? You don't have to.


Did you pass? I mean, they made you a hero, so obviously you did.


18 plus nine?


You can do multiples?


So I want to take Grog and push him up to see if he can essentially do what I did to K'Varn.


I mean, that's what the wait is for.


He's dead. (laughter)


We're going to have to fight things in this beautiful place?


I don't know what's happening right now.


I'd like to point out, the rakshasa with the hands. It's doing jazz hands!


Is it two-to-two right now?


Six plus four, ten.


Don't sound so upset about it.


So I'm okay. That's all I need to know.


But I'm just wondering if it fits. Never mind.


I'm going to dad thumb you.


I will aid.


You took a risk. Risks are okay. Got to be careful what risks you take, but without risks, we're never going to get what we want.


It's just pick-ups, right?


Fuck. I chose poorly. That's terrible. Yeah. Eight.


We might want to check and see if Allura, Gilmore, Kima, all our buddies are okay. Kash, Zahra.


Someone from the gnome community.


You can't even watch ASPCA commercials.


Let's not forget that within six hours of meeting each other, I ended up handing over an enormous sum of money to you.


Yeah, I’m hasted. The bonus action was - Oh, no, the action, right. The action was the spell.


I'm going to utility shot - I'm going to put my gun against the lock, somewhere where it will not harm her and just blow it.


That's okay too. That's okay too.


I start running towards the direction that was described.


I know. Is there a window?


Oh! Hey!


Just remind him to put some imperfections in it. He always likes to make things too beautiful.


Wisdom? Ten.


I can't tell anything about what's happening here. Port Damali. Nicodranas.


We are the acid reflux.


I'm speaking as myself right now. Marisha really likes dill.


We're both parents, we have kids, so we have no time to do anything. Enough time to take a shit. The first or second episode, the first episode is about us playing the first game, and there's audio from the first game. Again, go to iTunes, or to AllWorkNoPlay on Pod Bean, and you'll hear about two minutes of us dealing with a puzzle that Matt threw at us.


People would just come out screaming. They won't know where to go.


Maybe he's a friendly giant really creepy-looking entity.


He tripped.


When was this?


Right, no, I'm not arguing.


Tap me on the shoulder if you hear me because I cannot hear you.


Recon it.


They're long gone.


Ooh-hoo. Okay. All right. Everyone stay back. I'm going to start by casting the lowest level of spell out of it, see what it does.


Ah! That was close, guys. I saw my mother! Then I saw myself at math class, failing.


Oh, I can! I go into a black panther form.


Lootcrate, lootcrate, lootcrate.


No, no, no, you can't take that back!


No. She'll know I'm here when she feels a bullet hit her.


I read non-fiction.


Is it diluted by the water?


Oh my god, this is all my fault.


I thought you were going to hold your action so you could read the book after Pike did the trammel?


Does that work?


Your guess is as good as ours.


Scanlan, are you all right? You look a little poorer, somehow. Have you lost money? You look like you've lost money. Especially in the face.


I'm gonna go into that-- (all laugh)


And then I drop the smile as I walk off towards the other two.


Whatever it is, here is another four and keep another one for yourself.


Yeah, that's awesome.


I think so, yes.


But I'm so angry.


Episode 91, where we force Matt to make up an entire language on the spot.


That would be one of your top-level spells, yeah?


Which scene?


"When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to necrotic damage for one hour." Nice. Cool.


I think it's a 60-foot cone.


Just was faster than I thought.


I am not helping.


You need all the names of everybody involved?


You've got to help-- where the hell did he go?


No-- is ermahgerd.


Check that armoire or whatever it is.


(singsong) Szundie, Szundie, Szundie.


Is that a total party kill?


Can I inspire everyone?


Hells no!


No, I'm going to hide back in.


Jester, give me one of the Crownsguard helmets from your backpack.


I'll take another step back.


In the dark by myself. Oh, that is fucking hilarious.


I have a little cake eraser. Do you want the cake eraser for the game? Hang on. Where is it? Where did I put it? Happy birthday!


We were going to go on a winery tour.


Where is the meeting?


Artisanal half-elf slaves.


Someone shoot him in the mouth.


That's only fair!


I'm shooting a warning shot past his head, diving in, taking the--


What a fucking boss.


Okay. I'm going to cast Bless on Scanlan, Keyleth, and Percy.


How much money do we have?


Where does firbolg come from?


She might have some.


Yeah, that's just new--


We're going to eat that whole box.


He's been living in a cemetery--


A what check?


Well, what's the fine? How much was the fine?


No. No signing. (laughter)


Keep an eye on those goods, brother.


It's always like 20 degrees warmer in the valley.


I go ahead and I cast Enhance Ability on Vex.


A child?


You wouldn't hold your own daughter that way!


That's a big "what if?"


Not crisped, just scorched.


Let's get out of here, I'm going to be sick.


Because I don't know about you, but when I'm at home watching Critical Role, and someone gets a "how do you want to do this," I fucking scream! (cheering)


Oh, that does not hit. No, that does not hit. Seven.


Who's left?


It's alphabetical right on the list. Ooh.


No. I can take Pike.


I will hang out with her while you guys go check the house. Please bring me any books.


As opposed to all of the other things we've done?


10,000 gold, I mean, shit. Wouldn't mind earning 10,000 and then bouncing.


A limerick for you?


Stand guard, I'll be right back.


We are making some interesting calls tonight. It's exciting.


Well. Yeah. You would like to stay with him?


The sky. (singing) I think about it every--


We're taking him to Uriel, right?


It died! Yay, we killed it!


Do I have advantage in-- no.


And that's what you did?


Oh god! Save? 21.


What are we doing? Wait, what?


We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right into the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us.


You know, I don't know. (laughter)


Avoid the skeletons.


They keep talking about the heft of his equipment. A lot of reference to his equipment.


Fuck all y'all bitches!


I stuff the letters that we were planting on the High-Richter in the-- sorry, on Sutan into the safe.


You know what, I totally forgot to build Trinket a place to sleep.


Caleb, you got that photographic memory. You remember where those damn daggers are in the trees?


Hide your neighbors, hide your wife.


Can we come down?


Oh, yes! Try to grow a beard.


A religious leader, someone from the farming communities, someone from the economic community, someone from the trade community--


Yes. I'm sure you've heard of my father Kravanas, my mother Penelope? Tofor: "And perhaps you should close that trap and sit across the table as far from me as possible. "


But I've definitely got a Pass Without a Trace still on us.


Wow. What does the other side of failure look like?


Will Friedle won the first one, she won the last one.


And it hopefully goes--


Nope. I'm sinking it.


It's going to get worse. All right, and now I'm doing a sharpshooter shot.


You can do that?!


And I give him ten platinum, which is actually six.


I will - where are you?


Yeah, we'd like to avoid entanglements with the law, being so new and all.


Why don't we find out what happens next? And if we have to, you can teleport us out of here, correct?


Can we go around the sides--


I think it might also be smart to see if we can drum up any type of handwriting samples for possibly both the Lord Sutan and the High-Richter, so we can more convincingly forge documents.


Well, didn't you say there was an air pocket?


Molly, what do you think this means for the carnival?


I can get you there.


Yeah, fine.


If only Rambo Scanlan was here. (laughter)


Spoiler alert  we're saying no to that.


Kick his ass.


Taking a potion is an action or a bonus?


I leave.


We're gone, man, we're gone!


Okay, I'm going to inspire Grog with my bonus action.


At a disadvantage since I contradicted her?


I see what you're saying. Yeah.


Bye, darling!


Just going to watch, that's all. Do I see any security details? See who's guarding the place.


But is he confused?


Must have a bag or something.


Doty, did anyone see you do that to the guards?


(laughs) That's a good question. (laughter)


Any armor on the walls?


All these checks. Where's my medicine? There. 12.


No, then fuck it! I don't want that shit!


I'll take that bet. I'll take a three-gold bet.


She's a maid Marion?


Yes, I'll take the mouse.


Natural 19 from Gil. 22.


All right, I think from where I'm standing I'm close enough to see that Keyleth is absolutely mauling the tree, she's right on top of it, right?


Well, it tastes good, though. So there's that, too.


Sweet. As I'm now frustrated, I cast a 5th-level spell, and I will cast my Obelisk of Iron, three in a row behind me.


That was great. Man. [break]


Yep. Oh. I don't have the cat paper with me in this state that I'm in, because I didn't know I'd be playing.


Your shop is beautiful!


And she's really short.


No, that’s it. I rolled a three and a two plus a four. It’s not a lot of damage. I rolled crappy.


Oh no, my proficiency--


It's all muscle.


Yep. That was one, so for my second arrow--


They're so far, and I don't know what they can do. Probably a lot. I'll step towards that tree in front of me, in front of the bear and the girl.


How are we going to get you those wishes?


Yes. Fiction and non-fiction. A bit of everything. I was a--


There should be a laser in there somewhere.


I need to sleep. I got injured.


I'll put a little bundle on my staff as well.


Yeah. I'll be in the room.


I go around and I collect the gnoll ears and I put them in the jar.


Could be really great.


No. I mean, I've enjoyed it. This has been great, everything, everything has been great. This is wonderful, but I will admit I miss-- I don't know what I miss. I miss it, though. I feel like I'm tempting fate and I'm going to regret everything I say right now, one day.


Do you think she's still there, Grog?


She's a shark.


Well, 18, if I'm not using my thing.


You're right. Tiberius, where did the flying carpet go?


Do any of those ley lines go through where we were in Marquet?


I can do things, too.


These are dwarves?


19 plus four.


The best thing ever.


Just a reminder that everyone is rolling at advantage while the Cat's Paw holds it.


I have a plain old 50-foot rope. I'm going to try to tie it to something on the edge.


Lead should block it.


I want to get him in the shoulder, up here.


Okay. First attack gets 11.


No mention of Whitestone.


He could if he wanted to. He's really good at magic. He can make a cat appear and disappear whenever he wants.


And bonus action, can I pour some superior healing potion down Pike's beautiful throat?


Until we knock on the door, I imagine.


Yeah, if it weren't for the migraine. I'm sorry, by the way. You may be the only one who understands this, but I needed something that was mine for a little while. So little of who we are is ours, and I knew it would end, but it was nice.


Yeah! Avantika!


And by the way, it's going to be a hot second before the carts come back from the cave, right?


No, you can't give him that jewelry box!


I'm going to exit on that.


Vax? Can you sense Vecna? Is he still in the same place?


He's speaking literally, Grog.


No-- oh yeah, I haven't traveled much at all.


Boom! Right in the face. 16 to hit!


That's good. Just making sure. Because I thought that was what it was. I just wanted to double-check.


Wait a minute. We want to bait them, is that what we're trying to do?


No ill intent. Intent? Yes.


Do I see anyone else, and does anyone else look rough?


Oh, we have a lot of dragon bits.


They need use. I think it's fair.


Would there be a buyout cost, if we wanted to pay it? Is that just the straight-- or could there be some sort of deal?


The waiter is like, what?


So bad.


I'm going to make a medicine check for my horse.


You need money to go buy a stupid mask for a stupid robot?


I feel like when you're ready to know your past, I would support that and I would help you find it.


I take Grog by the arm, and I usher him out the door of the mansion.


As we head to the tree, I pull Grog aside, and I ask him: Are you all right, Grog? I mean, I know, I know you got your lady favors out of the way and all that, but... Scanlan was your bestie, right? Outside of Pike.


I'll go next. But I want to bring out my broom and hold it in my hand.


I will start with the first, the oldest.


Dr. Seuss trees. Not cool.


I jump in, too.


There's a first time for everything, I suppose.


Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?


(shouts) They have great sentimental value!


I would like to smash my Titanstone Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself. Gotta get some fire resistance because good god.


I might just wait for the carnival, actually.


Let’s see what the total is.


We are a bunch of assholes.


The shits it's just one end, the other, both. North, south, all at the same time. It's like a relay race.


Yeah, let's just pretend that's not really happening.


"This will be the day that I scry!" (all laugh)


One more, this one is worth two points. A female kenku paladin with no arms or legs.


Should we go to visit our old friend?


The fuck.


Throw a pencil at me, dungeon master!


If it's a chest, can we put some coins sticking out of it? So it looks like it's full?


Yes, so as long as we stay within 30 feet of you, we get plus ten to our stealth bonus, which would be very helpful.


All those people.


Oh my god. Has anybody seen my shoe that I dropped earlier around here?


What am I going to do to gas? Hit it? Can I start running up the motherfucking stairs and jump up like Vax did? He said to kill!


Man, how awesome would this be?


You need to sneak in and you need to try to unhook the ropes, okay?


Natural 20! Thanks, Gil!


That was so expensive!


That's actually a good idea. I'm also going to--


You can pull him towards the ground, can't you?


Oh yeah, no, I'm out again. But she's out of shots.


Can we trick him into the mansion?


Okay. So it's not new. Okay.


Let's be honest, that gate's going to jack us up. It's going to be full of trouble.


Ten minutes is a long time if it's right at the beginning of the fight.


And we thank you.


Maybe. I'm reading the book.


Do you know that there is a dead person in the basement here?


Honey Heist! Honey, Honey Heist!


Damn it, Jessie!


Because it doesn't seem like we have a good plan right now.


Oh. Yeah, right.


Negative two. Nine.


Not really.


No, that's something.


Find me on Twitter. Let's talk about that.


By name.


He's pretty tall. He's a big guy.


10 33, yeah.


They want eyes, tongue, heart, claws, and teeth.


We need the mansion to sleep. We can't sleep anywhere without the mansion.


I stand over Kaylie and I cast Revivify.


In private.


Can I pop in a bonus action? I meant to take a potion anyway.


No. I don't even have time, I just want to talk to you.


But the flag, is it possible someone might recognize the flag?


We're down to one!


My friends call me Jester.


So. (swiping) (meow) 15. It can move as well.


If it was sharp, it would be a functional weapon.


I put down my gun, and I turn the barrel, and of the six barrels, five of them have names, and Lord and Lady Briarwood are two of those names. Dr. Ripley is another.


You can make your own assumptions.


They don't see us, but they know we're nearby.


It's not hard to hit an elephant.


Yeah, I rolled a two.


Mine.


I don't know, where is everybody?


I understand that. I don't want to keep the bag. I want to have it before you go off to do, I don't know, maybe you're going on a tour or something?


Technically. He's not going to last that long, guys.


And farting a lot.


Jester, now, that doesn't seem to cover who you're looking for, though.


Oh, so definitely do a Feast?


I'm BS-ing!


I cast spells with them. I need just a couple.


Yes, pleasure.


What's your name, woman?


I'll turn over my shoulder.


And then back-- yeah, right behind Grog, and I drag him behind Vex and Grog, back by Keyleth. (airplane noise)


Nope, no idea. None, nope. I have no idea.


There is a dragon.


You've got that inspiration die.


One more. 19 to hit.


It's not important. He was just a nice man.


Well, Zac was talking over you.


But we have the book. Yeah.


I know, basically, I just--


What if he flies?


I can't say it. You've got say it.


I look in my pocket to where I was keeping the dust that was Vax. Is there anything there?


Pulled apart by gators. Probably something creepy and howling eating you as well.


Did you make it to the acid pits?


Oh, that's awesome! Okay. 35. (yelling)


It's in my drink!


On the one that was a 20.


45.


When was the last time you left your house, Cleff?


You're two feet tall. He's a dragon.


I mean, how much does she make for a performance like that?


I'm going to quickly take a look at the papers that were buried in--


Do I get to assist since I gave him a kiss?


Bodies have been showing up outside this building. Multiple bodies. We're not going to get into the details, but we've been sent here to stop that from happening any further.


Yeah. Hai!


It gives you advantage on stealth checks!


Eyes closed.


A tray of bread on the counter.


How many people? You said two?


Okay, ready, ready, ready? Boulder, parchment, or shears. Okay. Ready? On three.


What, me? Bah! How tall is the thing?


Five and seven?


I gave you some gloves.


I'm out, dude. I've got five hit points.


Comic went up on Wednesday.


That was shot one.


I've never felt anything like that before.


We like to have fun at our job.


Trinket's going to run next to Vax.


Yeah, here, these are for you.


Who is it?


I’m going, too.


I made my bed. Now I gotta lie in it. I'll see you soon. I follow.


I'm going to do bottom left.


You want to work on it? Or you want to fly around?


I already did. Those are good rolls!


I hope that doesn't get rid of all your other spells.


Okay, good. It's acid.


We'd better run.


So, it takes a peculiar person to know what's peculiar?


Hold the side, like this? Yes.


Oh shit. That's a good spell.


Who is this?


I've been slowly heating water and giving it to Vax to put in his bath.


Once.


Oh yeah, it's a nine.


Sin eater!


Was that Gwen Stefani?


Guys, thanks so much.


(as Yasha) No problem.


Sorry, I just figured you want some company. It's really tranquil, isn't it?


No? Oh. Nope, that misses.


I'm going to stand at the back of the boat.


How dark is it?


Oh my god. Holy shit. Before we go any further, wait.


That's a vestige right there!


Déja vu.


But we can hide over the edge so he can't see us, right?


Oh, it's fascinating. We learned that whoever owns this place owns the district, isn't that correct?


I can see them, right? They're close enough?


That's fine; I need to get my gun. anyway.


Grog, would you engage in a fight with a magical being who wronged you, if you thought you were better than him?


'Cause of the basilisk.


The good news is is that if Twiggy actually killed the dragon-- which you obviously did--


I pull out my little book of druid spells and history, and I start freshening up on some fire spells.


Or 11, really.


We have traveled near and far, great Grood.


Scanlan, is there a hot springs in this mansion?


I don't think I can puppet her. I can tell her to do commands.


No, sorry, no.


They transferred the entire city there.


I know, but if he's looking right at me-- I mean, he can see me, essentially, looking right at me, correct?


Trinket got a natural 20! (cheering)


I see. Prestidigitation. Some chalk.


Can he do that with concentration?


Is theirs better than ours?


Wow, guys.


What did that riddle say? Something about a name. A name must be earned?


He can "bear-ly" hold one. (groans and laughter)


I... Yes, that is in fact a pig's head. It's complicated.


What does the Meat Man mean to you?


Who do we make him fall in love with?


Yeah, I'm special. Nott has a dot matrix printer.


Yeah, I'm just like a poodle over a pool right now, just doggy paddling instinctually. Do we have the lodestones, do we have all of them?


I am putting Percy's hand grenade inside this bag along with a diamond. Oh, it's a really pretty diamond.


Oh, shoot! I'm a nine. I didn't say, sorry.


Four again.


I know I have it. Oh, it's because I chose my Spirit Totem.


It's us!


I love this.


Can I touch him?


A Robe of Flaying?!


Oh, I can sometimes help people. You never know.


Strange that he had all those wyverns with him, though. Umbrasyl had none. He was by himself.


That's a great idea. Spectacularly great idea.


It's a Swedish dwarf!


Oh, he listens to me now?


The way he cocks his gun. (groans) Holds it so firmly. It trembles just a little but then bang. (moans) Just a gentle touch is all it takes.


Up top! And I'm going to dump 2nd-level Smite.


I should learn how to make potions. I should learn this.


You guys, we made 3000 subs and I have a promise to keep. I don't expect any of you to, but Erika and Hector have come back from home.


We've just been sitting here this whole time!


Grog, we'll give you a whole thing of it!


Outstanding. I tell you what, if you get full, we'll celebrate this upcoming day as your birthday.


English breakfast ale!


Look, Tiberius, it has sentimental value. We'll put it in Greyskull Keep. Just put it in the bag.


Like the gas range, he's trying to--


Let's check the other room, and--


No wonder I don't have it in my notes.


Yes, well, we like to talk.


You brought me from a four to a seven.


I'm going to yell up at the thing, we never decided where you would send the check for those boys! My address is 1 Greyskull Keep, Emon, 90210, courtesy of François Bertrand Jean-Luc Australia! But you should really forward it to Percival von Fredrickstein von Musel de Rolo!


That is also the most exciting night Kumas has had in ten years.


Oh, Pike.


I should have stayed.


Has it been built?


That's, like, 80 points of damage!


Can I find my way to Zanror? Is his-- is she his wife? His woman--


He's sleeping in, isn't he?


Right as Vax walks in-- Fuck!


Now we got to twist them?


Oh, that's going to fuck me up. (rapping) You've got those moves like dagger! You're fast as a cat! You can attack five times-- I checked it with Matt! You can't be killed, and one more caveat: You get to sit next to the Poohbah de Doink of All This and That! So imagine a dark room, lit from above. Folks as far as Czech Republic came to give you their love. Your heart is beating like a goddamn drum. It's singing, "I'm going back to Indiana, Indiana, here I come!" The tension is building, the roof's going to blow. This ain't a rehearsal, it's the motherfucking live show! Mic's rolling, camera's on, dice rolling, Scanlan's song. No more cajoling, this shit is on. This crowd is bigger than my cube-like dong! (cheering)


I mean, you really are.


I fucking drop Lady Briarwood on her face, hard.


That's all right. They've died before. Might need food, as well.


Mansion.


He's done, you are with friends.


Oh, yeah. That is a 15.


I may deserve that but no, no. It's not like that at all.


All of the dragon's teeth and three of the vials of blood?


Can't get the golem, but you can get the cricket.


Regular gnoll! (laughter)


Mr. Caleb--


Are you blushing?


Unless they know what's underneath the castle, there's nothing of value here.


Okay. Did I see the child go down?


It looped around?


While she does Greater Restoration, I want to go over and--


Another six.


Around.


Okay. Hit it again. That was such bullshit. 11.


Should we get anything to drink first? Or just dive in?


Good. I feel really stupid right now. Fuck! I'm going to try going underneath the tree where Keyleth said. Where the little treehouse was.


Yeah, there's no air, I don't think.


Yes! Okay.


And I want to fly on past and go up to the next roof.


Sure. How much to play your game?


So it's an island.


But we're listening in.


That was my wife.


Can I make both my attacks reckless, Great Weapon Master attacks?


It's a good one, though.


No, I'm not. I'm going to hold for a turn.


(mouthing) What's her name?


So I'll just regular old attack and I can only get one of them.


Slytherin. (all laugh)


I feel too guilty to say no to her. I'm perfectly content to let this go.


You killed the wind!


I'll go get Caleb.


Okay, because I'll give you two copper if I get one of those pickles.


Feels like you had to reach for that. You stammered a little.


Percival Frederickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, you will fight this monster inside of you!


Oh no. Oh jeez. Oh man, I love it.


As that one turns, I'll turn to Yasha and I'll go (hisses) and punch her in the face and say, "Go down!"


He said that there was a thing in your family. A blood curse. He seemed honest enough when he was saying it. Said that people paid the price for a slight someone made a long time ago, and certain members of your family are cursed, and he's had these premonitions, these dreams, before. It was his brother who passed away a long time ago.


(sings tune to "Single Ladies.")


Doesn't she have Sentinel?


You never noticed Toya acting weird? You were never like, "Oh, this is a strange--"


His dad is much better.


Okay, well then I'm gonna take the rest of my action, I'm just going to angrily slam into the tree, and see if I can catch the tree up under him on fire.


Me? I have to do something now?


I'm sure we've got bread around here somewhere, just find something to soak all of that up.


All of us up at the same time.


Swordfish.


Just someone with a lot of sordid history with these motherfuckers. Skeletons in the closet.


I'm sorry, no, I don't know them.


I don't think Eyebite's going to work against it. So, fuck, I'll cast Bigby's Hand at 6th-level, then.


I just let out a (yelps). (all laugh)


I will throw a Wand of Fireballs at it.


Oh, right! It doesn't drown, it's amazing. It's like it's magic or something. We had good times.


We've been told about that place!


Spent all that time figuring out what I was going to do and then they fell in a crack.


I have no idea of the layout of this room. I was just going for a gag.


I spin three times in a circle.


You cracked the tower! What is the matter with you?!


Four and a five.


Is this persuasion, solely? 20.


(whispers) Always remember your first one.


I put Trinket back in.


(worried laughter)


Attractive.


It might do for you to apologize.


Incredible!


It's a big anniversary for them.


Once we get there and survey the area, we can come up with a comfortable plan. You can make some caverns for them to hide in.


We're carrying nothing.


"To high doh," to high, though. It means something? All these words are real. "Up to high doh" means a lot? I don't know!


They're Boots of Taste that you have.


So we that leaves one left and we don't know what says. There's no Thieves' Cant on this door?


Over their earrings, they hear, he also dropped a loaf.


Insight check. That is a 20.


Moving forward. Keeping an eye out for those--


Actually, yeah, let me do that. I am going to cast a Tidal Wave right here and I'm going to go outward in this direction, and it's ten foot wide and 30 foot long, so let me back up a little bit out of it.


Have you ever transmuted anything before?


You pay at the end of the deal.


Come here, come here!


I care for you, Pike. I've always loved you since the moment I met you and I'm so happy that we became friends as well.


I'm sorry, but I'm looking for the highest quality ink. Do you know what I mean?


We are not Bastions. And we are not here to accuse. And we are not here to investigate your establishment.


Fucking golden snitch.


I think what you said was right; we might have to knock them out. So maybe we target one at a time? I hold Vax, and you come in.


How can we buy his freedom?


Wait, Senokir, before you do that, is it safe for us to teleport out of here? You won't mind?


Yes, and we plan on it, but we know that the Slayer's Take is full of very strong, very qualified fighters and we were hoping to have you at our side as well.


That's better than what I rolled.


Is it still there?


Some tea for the road. I've got a bit of it left. (laughing)


Are we going to this volcano under the water?


Yeah, we're just sweating a little bit more.


Can I, like, Homer Simpson (slurps) into the wall?


The old Alaskan pipeline.


Wait, is it Travis or is it me?


No, I was holding the chain and they stepped forward.


Have you experienced that once?


Friends! Friends!


It's 120.


All right, yes, let's do that so Grog can feel like he gets part of this, too. And if I can, I'd like to burn a big S in his chest.


Rule royalty. That's pretty fucking cool, Keyleth.


Marisha is broken!


It's a fire elemental?


Something I don't recognize. 12.


As I'm looking, is it Nott and then octopus behind it, or is it enveloping him so I can't--


Go team!


(snoring) (laughter)


Well yeah, okay. 30.


I am really well-hidden.


Please be more than 18.


Tibs and I are in the front, right? Because we both took aggressive postures.
