We don't want to make too much noise. I'm going to shoot a couple.


All I want to do is find the damn treasure room.


(heavy thud) Nott, what is this made out of?


I don't know, I said I was.


Fuck those idiots.


I was just wrong about, yeah, the city. That's it.


I'm trying to give you a fast way down, motherfucker.


Of course, darling.


Sorry, guys. We've never been on stage before. It's a learning curve. We'll figure it out.


Hit.


Second attack is just-- can I do regular?


I guess I could maybe-- can I try to cast Mending on the sail and see if it looks like the burn damage goes away?


Some people have no sense of fucking honor! (laughter)


Yeah, it's all Beard Papa.


He's so moody.


I'm not angry.


66?!


So let's sleep for a good six hours?


He fought against Vecna! They destroyed each other. It's the reason Vecna was destroyed to begin with.


We still dropped a few.


Fuck. I hope these aren't my--


That fucking smirk.


Trinket, everything's fine! You're just underwater.


Now, you can sleep with your clothes on.


I'm honored. Truly I am. But I lost a family, all those years ago. And while I will always think fondly of you, I have a new family now, and I must stay and guard them with my life.


What is with the dice tonight?


If we can save one, we can everybody, possibly. I haven't seen it yet. I'm going to try and get a little closer to it, gently.


Sure. Doty is brushing my teeth.


A hotis. A hotis?


I think I might have some abilities that can help, but I knew I could not do it alone, and I saw you have abilities, too.


May I ask-- Vestiges, the word in these legends, it seems vague. Does no one know anything about what they were? Is that a stand-in for things we don't understand or know about? What are these Vestiges?


Let's set down right in the middle of the thing.


No, I mean, usually you're so good at everything, but yesterday you were just-- maybe you needed the sleep, is what you needed.


You know, public speaking is not really my strong suit. Okay. Ordered and paid in advance by anonymous.


No button? Button!


Can I do a nature check to find out how fucking big this guy is?


It tastes like Saturday, certainly.


You got pissed on.


All right, then, I suppose he just has to roll on top of me.


That was luck. That was dumb luck.


Perhaps we should all go to bed, and the humans back in North Hollywood should take a pee break. At some point.


Something I wanted to do last night. In all the hubbub that's going on in Westruun, I spend some time to find my sister, and I wanted to stealth up on her.


There's going to be art for that.


It's going to be so fleek. Streets ahead.


And hairy chest. Just full hairy chest.


Thordak, from what I understand, is extremely powerful and influential. That Raishan dragon is a mere pittance in comparison. A small, exponential ant, a pawn, if you will, on the battlefield.


Very clever eel.


Yeah, he's attacking a gloomstalker; I'll join in.


So 20 "foint?" 20 "foint" of "movemoint."


Regular rage, and swing away.


Keep it up!


I liked her.


This music is so stressful!


To travel incognito, but--


I just don't know, because Pike's heart might belong to somebody else.


Oh, Jesus Ballsacks, who art in heaven.


Well, that's good. I don't think we could take another one right now, anyway.


Freaky Friday!


Oh, wow! We're going there.


Too bad I didn't recognize the last one.


A wacky waver.


Wait, should we-- those are bad guys, right?


These are special.


We're not begging in Stillben. Will you give the guy some fucking coin so we can get the fuck out of here?


I hate you all.


Tight. Okay, she's going to appear in the tree in front of me. Next to Fjord.


What if it explodes the lock and then we're not able to get in at all?


Wait. Why?


Come on motherfucker.


Next time, I'll use the other finger.


For the fourth arrow.


No, you look great.


Silly.


He weighs like 600 pounds.


It's not Cinco de Mayo.


My mom said.


Oh, it is a firbolg thing! Well, fuck, that's awesome!


Kick it off away to the corner.


No, yeah, he was really... right?


Can I feed this thing a healing potion?


I'm looking at our friend.


You know, I kind of like it.


Did you like that?


Okay. It has been way too long since I've done this. It's making me a little nervous. There we are. That's 11 points of piercing damage. That's with three points of necro in there.


If anyone works for Apple and wants to send us all new iPads. (All laugh.)


Oh, okay. I'm going to do the first arrow and then I'll try to put him to sleep. Okay, smart. Thank you.


Never put myself in danger except for the illithid. Never put myself in danger. The fire thing. Now granted, I didn't know how Fireball worked at the time.


No! We're doing this thing, Nott. We're pushing through.


There is a rakshasa after my brother and our cleric friend, Pike. And, unfortunately, I fear he will return if we don't snuff him out at the source.


I don't think I've ever rolled that before.


I'm going to drop back down the hall.


Fjord, I know we've heard the story probably a dozen times, but can you refresh us on what happened the day this ship sank?


It's actually there, and I will get you another one. (laughter)


It's very high! I use Awakened Mind to once more say, now we have seen what you have been through. We see the terror that you face every day from this awful beast. This is your chance. You may not have another. Fight him with us and destroy this beast forever.


They're barbarians as well?


It was a cube, Tary. Like a cube.


Aw, Doty, poor bastard! [break]


Frumpkin's not going in?


I'll keep close to the guards and the box.


Scanlan has it.


That is the most Brian Blessed thing ever.


You have to roll under the spell damage.


Do tell, Matt.


Okay. I'll circle. I don't know, I can't even really see where I am, but. Yeah.


(laughing) Go kill it, just punch the door!


On top of Pass Without a Trace. Hide in Plain Sight.


First thing I'm going to do is tell the servants, get these children out of their chains. You, either hide or help. Don't care. Turning around, out of the room.


You did it again!


I don't have Cure Wounds.


Vax, do you need my help to unlock it?


Talk to the hive.


Do you have charcoal?


Significant improvement.


Oh no, don't take it away.


Right around your waistline.


Yeah, shoot some arrows!


Kind of, yes.


And if we don't see one, then Fjord, you're the biggest.


Can I do an insight check? Did it look like she cast a spell just then?


Okay. Six, eight, 14, 16, 17. 23... 28, 32. 33.


(whispers) Is he an idiot?


Get closer.


Well, I would have to ask the DM. I don't know about this. That bubble, I don't know if it is soundproof at all because I just got that spell.


In answer to your quiet question, I could take the silver thread out and--


Oh, you know, it's just really cold and rainy, but it's good. It's good. I've missed you guys so bad.


We'll go with, right?


Cali. Calianna, that's cool.


Who all is around to see this?


I feel along the edge under her mattress and see if I can feel any keys.


Vex'ahlia.


Beyond.


Whispers?


Only a ten for me.


Look out, Guile, look out.


Can you do any like tosses? Like color guard?


Well yeah!


Do you want to hang out on the broom so you don't actually step--


You're not?


That's what I'm talking about. The minute we leave, we're outlaws. They've told us not to go.


They have those?


And you can Fly Trinket, too?


You don't know anyone else that has made a habit of doing this regularly, then?


Back to The Leaky Tap, then? Get our stuff together?


We're going to be indoors. It doesn't matter what time we go to attack the castle.


Does that mean these are magic? I can't remember what this thing does.


Trinket's going to run and stand next to Pike, to protect her.


That arrow just went slow mo.


Because I know the mountains, are we still on that crappy narrow precipice?


Or a 10% chance--


And remember, this is happening in about ten seconds.


Fetch him. Now.


I will unleash the full fury of my falchion into his side.


I just had a feeling overcome me, that I was-- I've never done anything like that before.


Maybe we can shoot Daylight directly into his eyeball.


Yeah, it's a sphere of darkness with stars with milky tentacles whipping around. That's what it says.


Yeah, let's go check in.


We need to hide.


That's a season two thing.


We have three horses, and there's five of us.


Air pocket.


We don't know, though.


That's right. We're a few members of the group known as the Mighty Nein. We would like to take one of those listings off your hand, if we could.


It's a big ass sphere.


Yeah. It can be confusing. Especially in the dark, right?


Oh, it's you getting the elbow drop.


It doesn't have that on the--


Are there steps?


That's right. What is my strength? It is seven. I'm as weak as Grog is stupid. (laughter)


I thought it would be added into the weapon, naturally.


Then we both turn and look at Grog.


Let's put that in the pile, too.


Jester feels like that perhaps she is imposing, bringing all of us here, and we are trying to convince her that that is silly.


(mutters)


Yeah, can we attack her?


Is it your intention to continue on with us?


The party keeps going! Cordell! Cordell, open another bottle!


Oh shit, right.


What he has done to prepare for the inevitable attempts to re-bind him.


I'm thinking a male deer. Yes, a stag. A white stag. Any stag, really, just an animal that's big.


I'll take whatever's most expensive.


Snakes have, like, two hit points.


They could theoretically, if we get caught.


We've been stuck in his digestive tract!


Spindly, what?


I will still do it.


You know this really isn't what we need. This is only the appetizer, maybe we should try to find the main course.


It's this guy I know. His name's Bigby, he has a big hand.


Oh no. A second shot?


Don't worry, Grog. We have a wonderful tailor.


Wow, that brought it back.


Is there water running to the left or the right? Does it look like it picks up current on either side?


I had a bottle of air!


Oh, sure, yeah. I'm sorry. I'm farsighted. So sorry.


This ale is amazing, that I'm drinking right now.


Yeah, but get under the tent! We can get the drop!


Is it small enough to where I can do the wedge myself--


I'm not dreaming. I'm not dreaming.


Yes. I'm going to honor your wishes, Vax. I'm going to go swim.


And Travis?


Could I try healing? A very concentrated energy just on his foot? A healing spell?


But quiet.


Well, look. She's been... She just gave me the wrong vibe, up front.


That is so offensive.


Fred.


And the third one is a natural 20.


Just move to the right.


It's good.


I got this amazing Tiberius pin.


Hey! Reckless attack.


Kiki, we've always been friends.


We've got to figure out what all this stuff is, first. I mean, just so it's not a pole and a pair of shitty boots.


He likes it if you talk to him.


Yep. Yep.


That's a stretch.


Okay, and then--


I have a little bit left over. I gave her a third of a barrel worth, like twice this.


Don't. I grab him and I start walking out of the room.


I'm going to try to shuffle back into the tunnel there a little bit. And for my bonus, I'll Healing Word myself.


The sleeves are little too short on all of the jackets, so we remember.


Did you go to college?


Water.


You heard? I'm new at praying. I'm sorry for all the cursing at first. I had a lot of emotions, and I didn't know if anyone was listening. Apologies, but you heard me at night?


I start tossing water out of this lake.


I believe it teleported somewhere in the northern hemisphere. Somewhere in a cold region. We think Wildemount.


It looks dangerous. I think it's worth--


No one told me he had a lightsaber.


(laughs) Pucker point.


It is a sigil of our group that is sometimes viewed just to focus one's energy.


Well, they know now.


That's quite the story. Can I insight check him?


I'll be with you.


Don't worry. We took care of it.


That went south. That went seriously south.


Yeah, I feel like we've kept him up long enough. We don't have to get him out, we just have to give him the chance to get out. I think we should do that. He's given us everything.


Is that near the Fields of Elysium, or a totally different place?


And I like the influence that everyone has on each other, and this includes, perhaps, you taking some strides with yourself. (sighs)


Soon! So soon!


Are you coming with, buddy?


After a moment passes, I stand behind Caduceus' tall frame and quietly cast Detect Magic.


Did, they-- oh. Hi, honey!


(laughs) Oh, acrobatics, 12.


That's what inspired us to do it.


No, all of us are doing it. Whoever wants to be stealthy and be a brilliant person, I guess.


Oh, Elven.


Not... not a given.


Beautiful handwriting.


Let's see how good you are at following. And he heads out.


Promise me you'll come back with me, no matter what.


Let's go! let's go! And we're going to head for a tree.


No, Trinket's around.


We have to decide what to do. He's gone back to his hole. He's going to rest. He's going to heal.


(tearfully) They're dead!


Witchcraft!


Frumpkin climbs up Molly's back.


I'm so ashamed right now.


Do we get to know how dangerous they are to us?


About a minute, I think?


So unless we're short on ideas, we might have to starburst this thing. Scatter it.


I cover tiny Scanlan's eyes.


And I'm going to channel myself through the bat and I'm going to make him fly down the far left tunnel.


So I have to expend a superiority die, and I add this-- yeah. Oh, fuck you! Now you're going to work? So that's nine more points. Sorry.


I have human jerky.


Yes, we still have enough, so.


Get 'em undone.


And I take out a little metal wire, and I add to this conversation and say, you are responsible for this animal's stealth checks.


Go, Grog.


She's a loner.


Am I with these guys yet?


He will be.


This door cost a lot of money, just so you know.


Wait, is that ding to your saving throws considered a curse?


You betrayed some bitches, that's what you did.


Way back in the beginning.


Oh no. Wait, what?!


It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points.


Yeah, it's like magic people code.


From, right, from up? Or down.


Oh, we have to kill all the fuckers?


(laughs) When you put it like that.


Yeah, I do. Five more, of course. Dream come true, make it happen.


Hi! We have things to buy and sell from you.


Okay. (counting) Seven, ten, 27.


Have we not done a drunk episode?


So you're nomadic. Do you have little huts you put up as camping tents?


I would like to evaluate whether or not we could climb this mountain.


You'll be really, really big and you'll be able to swim a lot better. All right? Just remember to follow my lead. And I'm gonna hang onto you when you are a whale, all right?


Oh, well then fuck it. Oh, you're injured badly? Would I know that?


I'm going to use my Aberration Bane sword. Shortsword, or whatever it is. I have never used it.


A tablet? A door?


I feel like he would've told us to avoid it.


The gold ring have any sort of symbol on it? Symbol of the snake?


(chuckling) You pulling your eyebrows off?


You suck, Kern!


Just as long as it's a threshold crest.


They're real big, right?


Neither can the fans, steamy Dr. Mercer.


Reginald, how much do your murderers know? About us?


Yes. Thunder damage.


It's connected to-- That's not going to work.


Can the episode title be "Dicks and Dicks"? (laughter)


You are the only ones who can speak Abyssal.


Sorry. Happens sometimes.


Show them support, show them love, guys. They really appreciate it. Tweet at them, follow them on Facebook, add them as a LinkedIn friend. Sext them.


You've taught me so much, but not about the human heart. (sighs) I am so sorry. I should have trusted you.


Oh, it was 16 on the last one! Does that hit?


I can cast in Beast Shape, Shapechange is a spell, so if I'm a dragon, beholder, that's what you get.


Nope! Just drunkenly popped in my head.


Can I do that, though?


6.2, 6.4, 6.5.


We're walking.


We're going back? Find a cove?


He had rations! No one takes rations!


Damn it. Okay, I will share that information with the group. I saw some weirdos running around.


Wait, I can hear you.


It changes in the air.


What I'm really excited about is that card was at the live show, and it is not in my stuff right now, but I did.


Now that it's distracted, does that give me some sort of advantage?


I think it would be possible to find people who would be delighted for outsiders to come in and do their dirty work for them.


And we're still supporting 826LA, so you can still donate.


It's true. Vax wanted to go inside the dragon, I was like, no! No, let's do it! (laughter)


Plus five on his con? That's great to know.


I'm curious about the sleeping thing you have, and again, anything you're particularly proud of.


I will lie down flat on my back.


No, the red dragon.


Grog, how are you feeling?


That hits. 30.


Fuck it, we'll go back up above deck, and we'll jump off the stern in the direction that Jester--


Caleb, that's deeply fucked up, you know that, right?


Lockheed has a higher chance of being dead than Tiberius.


I gain one level of exhaustion with a rage hit.


Alphabetical order.


Okie dokie.


Water and sky.


Do me a favor and stay down there. It's a real party up here, and everybody's dead.


That shit was too loud from a weird direction. I got all haunted house for a second. I was like, (gasps).


And we can't carry their stuff without.


Okay, that's good.16 plus seven is--


We should definitely go there. We need to look at the Cobalt Reserve as well. We need to meet up with Allura, though. She was-- (sighs).


Can you guys keep it down? I can hear you from here.


How can she still do that?


We have--


My legend is spread far and wide, I'm sure.


Bugging out.


Okay. So that's a 26.


Fuck you. (laughter)


I love her. (laughter)


Thanks. I feel like a first mate should be astute.


I know, that seems a bit much for you guys.


Well, we'll find out won't we? What do you got?


Did it work? Try it on Tiberius.


Right, because you've got-- thank you.


Yeah, sounds like they have him on, yeah, a trailer.


I've never had that.


You said there's a wall of thorns?


Do the wink thing you do.


Gilmore. Good job.


To clear our name here in Zadash?


Good point. Did it meet us?


I guess. That's all I can fucking do.


I don't know, I feel deeply shamed by my suggestion now.


Where are all the other places they could wear it?


"All right" is not the statement of someone who's arguing.


All right. Travis?


I figured it was worth a shot. Best we're going to do.


Thank you, guys.


We did our taxes.


Oh no. What do we name him?


That's a great question.


This dragon is being violated in so many ways.


No, we're absolutely listening.


He mentioned the left.


Will you need some cold weather clothes, Zahra?


I have the Ioun Stone, but it doesn't do anything.


And then I jump out of the cart and run towards the horses. On the opposite side.


Because we might make so much money from the blacksmith.


Then I will continue along the edge to that pointy crack in the ground so I'm out of range.


Like the one that crashed.


There, bat-bear.


I'm working hard, buddy.


Didn't we-- nope. I Plane Shifted us out.


Huzzah! Happy Birthday!


To Uriel.


I don't understand sorcery at all.


Are you going to dance?


Healing stuff?


That sounded like a lot of dice.


You just want to kill everybody.


25 and a 22.


Yeah, go knock on strangers' doors and get candy from them.


I like how everybody's like, I am really not wise.


Okay. Should we buy anyone off to be like, "This ship's fine, we checked it."


Let's go glamping.


Okay, so I back up. I'm going to back up against the wall so I can duck behind it if I need to, and I call Trinket with me, for sure. And then I am going to lightning arrow him? I'm going to lightning arrow-- no. Jesus. I Hunter's Mark him!


Drop it in the Bag of Holding.


So wait, is it Vorugal? Is it Thordak?


Thirteen hundred, lovely, thank you.


Yeah, one is going to hook up to the wagon and I'll-- which wagon do we want to take?


I have none in my column.


Our first cameo.


Something called 'Insect Plague'.


I think he's got the point.


Okay. Good to know.


He's going to be missing by morning. They're going to know.


Not that we're looking for them, we're-- I don't feel very well and I don't have money for a proper physician. I'm sure we could find someone else.


Also the former quartermaster, Theodore Roosevelt. (laughter)


Guys, drama needs conflict.


Nope. Trust me, my system wasn't any better.


Now I'm going to take a shot at him. That's a 29.


Kill him.


Oh, you took us to where Saundor was. You didn't take us to the pond with the chick?


He's happy. He's in a better place.


I'm keeping watch over the toad head.


(laughs) It's not me!


You've ruined it.


Ophelia first, then Mollymauk. It's all along the way.


I think it's a, uh. A contact lens!


Grog got down to boysness and ended a fool's life.


Maybe up here.


Yeah, I don't believe you. You killed them.


Can I grab him and tackle him down behind these barrels? Can I try and drag him back?


Can you see anything, Beau?


Hopefully be back in time.


Yep, that's my girl.


There's a long sigh at the beginning of the round.


Like, is his mustache especially B.O.-y? Like, what? That's really gross.


You should use your glove and make a fire for us.


It's only been about 25 seconds, but we do eventually have to breathe.


(panicked gasping) Okay! Okay!


I'm going to hold Hold Person until these two are right under the guard.


What is it? Can you shoot fire from your hands? Can you shoot lightning from your hands? Can you catch things really well?


It smells like farts. (laughter)


Would you say you whip your reed back and forth? You whip your reed back and forth?


Did you catch it?


Well. It's pretty typical.


(quietly) Hate it.


It would be so cool, though.


Wow, those dice.


I don't know if Caleb is a firebug, or if I am.


Very fair.


We have the platinum. Let's see what happens. Let's smelt the platinum into the heads.


Oh, sorry. 22.


Oh, you'd be a good Wax! You'd be a good Waxilum. He was the lead character.


I go ahead and I Druidcraft one of my bark bracelets to put around her. For scrying, if you need it.


Oh. Okay. So I go up to the tree. Do I touch it? You're the tree. Hey, can you open up and take us to Crown-- what was it? Smouldercrown entrance, just 'cause. Wait, it would be way easier to just go straight to the pyramid.


I'm feel like I've got very little health. Like I'm bleeding a little bit from my ears.


All right, so catch me up, man!


I go-- around the corner.


What we are going to need is we need to sneak you in there, and we need you to take a movement.


I'd just like to find one, if I could.


Speak with Plants?


He died?


I use my Minor Illusion to create a (failure horn sound). (laughter)


I could have done that.


I just said we'll circle back.


11, oh, wow. Thank you.


If you cut the haversack, all of its contents spill out.


Wait, what did you just shoot at us?


Everyone. Everywhere.


What are you casting? What are you about to cast?


It is quite nice.


What was the damage before, DM?


What about a beard trimmer?


What does the boatswain do again?


Yes, we can.


Hey, look at this.


Uh, oh right, you're on the ground. Can I, ah, fuck. Okay.


I can check.


I think you would look fine either way, Fjord.


Y'all, don't get close to this guy, because I don't want to waste all my--


I feel like chewing on your own toenails is the worst villain origin possible.


We're fighting a horde of goliaths!


Fucking come back and get me! (all laugh)


Speak freely.


Do we want to get rid of the water, though? Because that's what's allowing us to breathe.


We're all going to die. We should leave now.


Oh, of course.


So. Mask. I'm just fascinated by the mask. Looks well-made. Did you make it?


I don't know anymore. I rolled really high, and I rolled my attack bonus, like a 19 plus 11? A 30?


Fun, imaginative world.


Leave your weapons.


Is it a blood pit or a lava pit?


We're all fucked.


He's got a map.


Understood. Do you know where we might be able to find him? Does he say where he stays?


No, I can make a better hand.


Okay. There's horses around here, let's steal them.


Is it unworked stone? What's the ground like?


Ooh, ten! Ten plus two, that's 12, plus six!


Eyes Wide Shut. (all laugh)


Don't hit me!


As they float away out of earshot, I say to my two friends here: you know, if need be, The Mighty Drei also sounds very cool.


This campaign is a social experiment.


Yeah, we need to camp because we need to rest and get our shit back.


So barring Laura's passport showing up--


It was mesmerizing, Jester. I mean, she really had an effect on the room. Was it just me, or did the lights seem to dance when she was singing?


What do you want to speak with her about?


What of eight days instead of two weeks? Oh, sorry.


No, 71.


I trust you. It's the only way to be sure.


Yeah, okay, okay, it's all right.


I don't know if you're a woman of faith, but--


The drow?


Tickets are on sale tomorrow!


As I wake up, I sit up and I go  Jester?


Okay, Fjord is going to walk up. "I'm a warlock." First, he's going to do-- I don't think this is a concentration thing, it's a bonus action. He's going to do Hexblade's Curse.


And that’s her, the one to the right of me?


Seems fake. (laughter)


Is it this size? Or this size?


That's true!


(surprised) Oh.


Wow, fuck you!


Your dad is very noble.


Well, we need to wait until they apprehend her.


Should we go find out?


I don't think they have rainy days.


(clears throat) Yeah, I don't feel like showing off my powers. I can't read the dirty hand of betrayal.


You can get it over there.


Is it further?


Lifeless


Oh god, too fast.


Who are these lovely kids right over here?


Oh, now we have to go. We can't let her die.


Pike, you there? Can you hear us?


It's only a few days.


It's still 24 hours since we had the feast, right? It still counts as the same time?


Let her know it's useless after the one use.


Looking away.


I'm so excited now to see what it spells out.


But I'm more interested in the healing potions.


Nicodranas!


Oh, you know, I'm just doing a walking tour? Through the continent, just kind of--


Balding. All right.


DM?


It's tough being the smart one, eh?


How far away-- oh boy!


Okay. I'll try.


Funny thing, that's what Craven Edge used to do, as well. Oh, what do I call you?


We wanted to throw him as far as we could.


(sighs) I can always use this for spare parts for other things.


Magic shop? Okay.


I got my Street Fighter gym bag.


Such a long walk!


I want to get up to the heavens. Oh, sorry. I'm going to actually, you know what? I'm going to move three feet backwards, that's it.


Yeah, we go get our own.


Gilmore's? Gilmore's?


Oh, it is U-T-U, Utugash. Okay.


We're going to hide?


Yeah, but this one gives her fire resistance.


Want to give him a pole or something?


I'm in the front. Makes sense!


Oh we're a bat-- bat's AC.


Fine!


And your nails are amazing.


It's like a Plinko machine.


We should hide the evidence.


Tary, I thought you left your home. Or were you kicked out?


Percy is.


I am already hanging out by the door to this place. I left 30 seconds ago.


Deep-ocean folk?


All right. Who's in need here?


Right arm.


You do you, man. You do you, guys.


Yeah, you guys are crazy.


Dispator.


It's a thin staircase. Three people won't be able to attack at once.


I would advise bringing them with us instead of stopping.


It's a word that people use when they want to sound ostentatious about how ostentatious something is.


Wall of Fire around the other?


Nein, I cannot do that, but I could walk away from this. Are we all leaving? There are actually pirates above?


Oh, the jug.


I'll take a picture if I have to! A natural 17.


Yeah. Don't look at me like that! You can look at me, just don't look at me like that! You're not going to look at me now, are you? Okay. It's fine. You know what, we'll talk about it tomorrow.


It is not the entire Tri-Spire, because--


Yeah, there was a 12 and I was like, what?


I may have hit a couple people in the face, for which I greatly apologize.


Can I put the sledgehammer on my back?


I'm going to look at everybody. I really wish I could help you with the rest of this, but I've got to get this thing away from you, you know? People will be after this, as soon as I can.


You got a lot of aggression. You got a lot of anger.


They've never worked a day in their life. Ten points of healing to Pikey.


Yeah, you're so good at that.


That's in the Wayback Machine.


(shouting) Bitch! Fucking bitch! God!


I am so cheating by following the rules in the book.


Okay. Vax?


Is there a front door?


I'm gonna feed Lockheed some treats.


I ask that of everyone I meet.


I'll go towards that [no audio] other one.


Well, okay, I'm definitely doing that while they're working on the dragon.


I will pick it!


Give us a hint.


Well, I mean, could just ask him to open the door. The ruckus has stopped and obviously, somebody won this fight.


The thing I was trying to attach to my gun but wasn't working, I'm going to try to attach it to my boot instead.


Only when you're really angry?


I'm right after you.


Speaking of time that it takes to travel, are we sure that Avantika was the only one who was interested in what Uk'otoa has to offer?


A three plus-- nine.


This is Clarota all fucking over again.


Well, it's still a really good time in the day we should go ahead and make preparations. Make our way back up?


Three each.


I will give you the change. Thank you, friend. I will pay you back.


Tiny Vax. Tiny Vax.


I just know we've heard it.


Huh! 19!


I know, so close!


Shit, we don't even need the servants for that. I just pop out the chalice, little morning beer. Sunrise.


With science.


Can someone borrow your broom?


Shit the bed. Yeah.


Big dice, don't fail! Natural 20!


One? 20?


About everyone.


What skills you got?


Oh wait. Do I get more because I'm level five now? "Spell damage increases when you reach--" Oh 2d8, yes. Oh, good. Three whole damage, woo.


Okay. All right, I'm going to touch Grog and cast Lesser Restoration.


Ja. Okay, Frumpkin. Would you like to-- are you still there? And he's still on the other side. I'm going to have a quick look. Somebody--


Finally.


But enough about us. Earlier, you were telling us about a poor family that came down with that disease. I'm just curious, coming from a medical family. What was the disease that they had?


I was trying to pitch him to Tary, but I really like him. I want him to stay.


That's what I do. That's what Tiberius does.


I'm going to saunter over.


13 on the second.


I don't want to waste time. Everything I do, I have to buy.


Any idea how long ships have been going down in that region?


Okay. Yeah. I have another bite.


Only if he notices the sword.


I'm a really good artist, Orly.


I'm so excited! But yes. Super nervous, because social skills aren't my strongest suit.


Excellent! (laughing)


Darktow's over here, right?


I think we're cool. Just let it play out.


Yeah, that's good. That is a 27.


For hitting?


Me first, yeah. Her dress sparkles too much.


You can call him Frumpkin.


Only if that is, you know, easy to do.


Is this about Kaylie? Because I'm still worried about her. But I don't think that we should discuss her right now. We have other things! Why are you harping on this? She's my daughter. (laughter)


I go over to Scanlan, and I just, I just lay my hands on him, and I cast Cure Wounds in a level 2 spot.


You know, it's not even really that intentional. I'll find myself picking at them every once in a while.


Don't challenge them.


Can I try it again?


And then I'm going to throw my bear arms wide and just like--


There's a lot of fires to put out, I guess.


I don't know. I don't know how balls work.


Uh, it's okay.


I'm going to go down and I'm going to motion for her to follow.


Oh! It's disadvantage, but I had advantage.


So it looks like we start right around here.


Remember, think back. It has already begun, and no one is here to stop it except for Vox Machina. Us.


Crouched, so both hands are on the ground.


Dwendalian Emp. That's good, 17.


But there seems to be the crossroads up there. There seems to be a path through the forest--


Yes. It's actually Underdark. I'm fluent.


Close by?


No, the smell means they’re good.


I'll use Disguise Self and I'll turn myself into a crownsguard.


How about this  Caleb and Caduceus and Fjord, you're one team. You have Frumpkin watch Fjord, you give me the word when it's good to go, I'll deliver that to Nott and Jessie, they go--


Do any of us see this?


Hopefully, it won't be immediately. And might I remind you that you did not help us in this fight. We did it all by ourselves.


I'll sing, (singing) do you really want to hurt me? Do you really want to bite my body? Okay, that taunts him.


(laughs) He just put the cone down in a lower place.


Wait, but doesn't he have protection?


CritRole!


The duke's. Okay, yes?


Oh, for god's sakes. You can't reason with angry people.


Apparently 2,800.


Caleb is blithely burning over here and has no idea what's going on behind him.


Yeah, glue the head back on. And then I chase after Scanlan.


I have to attune to it; it takes forever.


He is god. East guard.


Okay. Never know. Never know.


Of your sheet?


Walk him out and make sure that he gets on the boat?


If I ever died, I thought-- and I still think I'll probably be the first-- but if I ever died, I thought it would be more like a bus accident. I would just go (impact) and that'd be it. I didn't think the doctor would look at me and say, I'm sorry, you have one week to live. And the whole week I've been sweating.


Can I tell what material the black part of the hammer is made out of? If it's rock, metal, some sort of volcanic glass?


Fibulous! It will turn into a silver piece.


Nott, do you have anything you want to offer?


So you're telling me that somewhere in this castle there is a storage facility full of caustic acid that dissolves the very stones of this castle?


Wait, we haven't heard Tiberius' story as sorcerer. Then we can answer that question.


And just for Taliesin, I say  Stay in school! (laughter)


I just rolled a one.


Melee, so if he has a weapon or anything, hit him. If not, just knock him the fuck off the roof.


How do we stop being like this?


So is the wall hitting the roof?


Oh, you did! You did, you killed the one thing. Okay, good.


Pike, I've got good news, he says he's not here!


I know it!


Let's not do that just yet. Let's control current and see if we can fucking do it, with some light this time.


If I stand up in the cart as we go, can I see out into the grass?


Let me make a suggestion. And I cast Suggestion.


Doty, they're going to take our things. I know why you're here.


I can actually technically get advantage on the shot.


Oh, I didn't realize it was within range.


It's buried. Does it seem like the dirt that surrounds the Shadowfell? Is it that kind of dirt?


Do you have time?


I will throw out a feather and cast Feather Fall.


Powerful, confident, and enthralling, and I vow to use this to the betterment of our entire team, to make sure that none of us fall in battle, not me, not Percy, not you, not either of the elves, not short stuff or the big guy.


Taliesin, didn't you say you ran into a Critter who went and started to do D&D?


Where's Frumpkin?


You know, tourists. We have that tourist look.


By the way, there's something really, really cool on its way here for you. Like, really cool.


It was, it was bloody.


You seem like someone from The Guild.


What is it, dex?


I haven't taken any damage.


What? What?


It's fast, wait.


Gnoll cowards.


Yeah, we go look at the cart. Is it still there and protected?


Any ghosty globbies?


When you're good and ready.


What was the name of the creature again?


It's a two! (laughter)


Wow, that was very impressive!


Two guys and a bear with Charlie Sheen, new to CBS.


Don't tell him the price of anything.


Really? (all laugh)


Oh, I have to choose one


Yeah, for sure. Is that now?


I think we want to be a little further.


I'm aware.


Hey, kids, this is why you shouldn't drink during the daytime.


I’m going to try and drag him down towards the pit with the orb of death.


Briefly, back in the old days, they were experimenting with texting us whispers.


But we're only 80 yards out. Feet? 80 feet?


They're pretty good. Did you want me to make you something with the paint?


I'll hop on the broom. You hop on the carpet.


Roll a stealth check.


And I-- there wasn't even any rolls for that, right?


Let's leave a marker.


No you don't.


It's a pleasure. I can see where Jester gets her good looks from.


I know, I keep thinking of Allura's tower.


The chest is trapped.


Then we run.


Oh, wait. No no no, that's right, keep going. It's actually 15 damage. I always forget that I have a plus one to attack.


Oh yeah, there's nobody in there!


Right. As far as we know.


This thing.


I agree, can we camp out and hide?


Yeah, ow. Yeah.


I mean, that's about it. I think every once in a while, I would maybe try to see if I could see Vax or check in on him somehow, but I don't know how other than to scry.


"Junior? Junior! Git yer slowpoke, molasses ass down here."


Okay cool, then I'm gonna shoot him. Oh wait, no, I can't.


Plus three.


Well, I did a stealth check, and I got a 25--


They're both of the sea.


I don't, I suppose it depends on them, doesn't it?


Oh, I don't like it, someone else take it.


Just be prepared, the Emon you left isn't necessarily the Emon you'll be returning to. It's getting better, but it takes time.


Yeah, I can now be your companion, as of this week, in Fallout 4, if you build a robot and give it the male voice, I can be really polite to you for hours on end.


Perception is 30.


Right. (quietly) Do we still have all those jewels?


You know what? Retrace your steps.


Well, I have this jar. It's an oil of etherealness. You could potentially be standing in here, but not be in here. Lasts an hour, though. Same time gap as your friend. You could stand in here and not be in here.


And that's 21.


Who's behind me back there, way at the edge of the map?


Plus 2d6 necrotic.


Under the lake?


And a hula shirt.


Laura, is something wrong with your head?


Grog, you wouldn't have to do anything on your own.


Yes, absolutely. Let's do it.


Time to high noon is three minutes?


With a healer's kit, can you heal people when you're not in combat? Or is it just for stabilizing?


I try not to frighten people, but I figure if we're getting messy--


No way. There's no fucking way.


Is the giant eagle small enough to Dimension Door?


Got some new specs there.


What am I, stealthing right now, or checking for--


Right before the staircase, right inside.


Unless we know how to take on that dragon, we can't save anyone.


I'll take a big swig and get ready.


And a roof.


Will they?


Ten tables.


Oh god. I think you're out of range, so you don't get the plus ten anymore.


We can land and have a conversation.


Wait, so we don't know?


No, you were Prestidigitation-ed.


What about you? How do you feel?


Yeah. Do you not need it?


Fucking Pet Sematary up in this bitch.


What is she like?


Mute, as in silence noise, or a person?


You have a good time.


Okay! It's like she has a lot of jewelry, so something like around this big.


Do you want to propose it to the group? I'm happy to go, of course.


I love him!


I step out and I put on my meanest face that I learned from Sir Cadigan, and--


Maybe we can stop through on our way back. We are going to Marquet, aren't we?


But we'll bring him home, then we'll find your grandfather.


Those two. It's a line. Are they in a line?


Let the dice act better than us tonight, please. (group laughs)


No, I made this myself, because I wanted you all to know how passionate I was about tonight.


Let's not give anybody any indication we've been here.


The second one?


No, no. It added up to 39.


RPing that guy.


What? We're asking questions. We got to bring him back, just a little bit.


Well, so you know how last time when we went over there and Horace was just outside the city walls? I'm pretty sure if we wait for a bit, somebody will come out, we take him, we mess him up real good, maybe take his tongue out, chop off his arms, and then send him back in.


What's your vote?


Someone got you ice cream.


You haven't packed!


Vampires!


Oh, it's a 13.


I'm already good.


The range is 60 feet.


Last time I saw you, you were the runt of the goatball team.


I guess I am.


Okay, kill him.


Yeah, I'm shivering.


Yeah, good on him.


I was just gonna say, he's happy to grab, and I'll deal with that too.


Are you going to shoot your sister like you just pointed your gun at her? What was that about?


Divine Fury, all the bits.


Eight damage on first one. Second one, that was cocked. One more time, same attack, 19, with another four, that's eight damage. Then I'm going to just do one more with my offhand, I'm going to try and break his nose because that feels personal. 16?


It starts to fry his brain if he doesn't.


I like the chrome dome line.


Let's go find it!


You want to go buy a few more?


Yeah, like, dead arm. It's a little dead.


I think his ears are underwater.


I've got a wooden handle.


What? Who's that?


She didn't say my fucking name. (laughter)


Ooh, burn.


Do we fly up, or do we go inside and up the tower? I'm sure there's no traps or horrible things on the inside of it.


And you have arcane talents as well.


And the Vestige there is the staff?


No, I think you were moving along to try to go stealth and sometimes you should just stay put and see what happens. (all laugh)


And maybe ask them if they've seen your mom.


But it all looks the same.


Why you make us kill a baby? That was great.


I take and I rip off a piece of his robes. Tuck it away.


Percival's guns are really cool, and I've always wanted to have some of my own, and I used all of my ammunition over the year, and now I just have this pistol. And I produce the pistol. But it has no bullets! I don't know how to make any more bullets! I need more bullets!


We want to get rid of all of them, so follow these guys back to the bee's nest and we can take care of the hive.


Got a little bit of the Irish thing going on.


I will grab a healing draught and offer it.


No, they have to be invited.


Shit! Come on big whammy.


I would like to frenzy.


Yeah! So as I'm down, my eyes light up, and I start to turn into a giant. And I want to reach up and grab him by the throat and try and stand up and see if I can pile-drive him.


I worked at a library, the Cobalt Soul library.


Oh yeah, Tary had Luck, not Scanlan.


The only tower.


Oh, yeah, no. Maybe go take a shower.


I'll watch.


Molly, do you want some acid? Do you want to drop some acid?


Giant eagle is 80 feet.


Is it looking as we near it-- is it looking a little more put back together?


You can use Bigby's Hand to--


That could've been a cool name, though.


That would never happen. I'm more measured than all of you.


Our flag was burned by pirates.


That would be a sweet close to it. I met you in Ank'harel, didn't I?


You want me to pull on the branch?


I climb those motherfucking stairs.


I have looked all around the fountain and I'm not able to make anything out.


Living?


It means something. You'll remember it forever.


There we go. See? That wasn't great.


Who? Who who who who?


With advantage?!


Frumpkin can get there just ahead of me and peek around that corner before we turn it.


Oh, it's trying to grapple me? 18.


Don't say her name three times, then your rolls won't come true.


It holds your cards, it holds your dice, there's a bluetooth doohickey in it so you'll never lose your box with dice and cards. And you can get all kinds of woods, there's all kinds of tiers, you can get the Critical Role logo etched into any kind of box that they have. And if you want to go full wizard you can get the shnazzy Masterworks box, did I get that right?


Yeah. That's what they want.


What do you have in there?


We're getting another letter.


(vaporized noise)


That's a good title.


We were yeah.


I'm like the city lights of Los Angeles.


What if it's the Vecna dimension?


This is all very familiar to me.


I pick myself up out of my prone position there on the--


We normally have a no stranger policy, but we'll keep a close eye on you. If you get up to any tricksy business--


I am being actively watched?


I didn't know I had advantage, that's lovely. That's 18, 19, 20, 21. 25 points of damage and four points of psychic damage.


I will organize--


I've been informed by Jester that she is now to use the Wand of Smiles. (cheering)


Well, that's the thing. We can do both, but there is a timestamp on the people. We should take care of the people first. Because then we're increasing how much gold we will bring in because if they die then we will not get as much money for them if they are alive. We should get them alive. Get them out. Kill the baddies if we can at the same time, and if not, go back a second time.


Did you go in after them?


Does do that. There's nothing wrong with living your life. You only get one of them, or mostly. And your days are going to be the days that you're going to have and I'd like to keep living my life the way I'd like to and keep off of certain radars.


Fuck! Shut up! Shut up!


No comment. I plead the fifth.


Thaign. (cheering)


Yeah, it was!


I take a little paintbrush and I draw a smiley face on the rock.


Where's Percy? Oh there he is!


And the dragon is very dead. Very, very dead.


You going to be a guard or a tackle?


The Horn is on the carpet. It has been specifically not touched.


I'm popping out of my German accent. If I cast a concentration spell and then I use a scroll, does it drop the concentration check on--


What's his DC? What's your DC? Or is it versus his wisdom?


We hurt that Elder Brain real bad, but not bad enough.


Okay! What's the Blazing Bowstring, again? 1d10, okay.


I didn't even know you were in the room with us!


I don't think that's correct, actually. I think it's both things at the same time.


60 feet, yeah.


Okay! Hello, everybody!


Shouldn't you just go caw?


Let's get out of here. We don't need this.


But we can open the cell, at the very least.


What was it eating?


Did you find what you needed in your car, Sam?


Oh no. Who's it going for?!


Oh god. What do we do? She knows all of us.


Well, he didn't feel it.


To Grog, yeah.


I wasn't looking forward to this moment, but that actually sounds like fun.


Is it plus five? I forget.


Yeah, I'm going to try and stun them with that first one.


Do you want to come with me?


Yeah. He's got a sister, and I don't want you to do anything other than keep an eye on her and keep her safe.


It is quite nice. Well, you're welcome to stay.


I'd be Trinket.


That's right, you used your Wish last night.


Yeah. I can see fuck-all through this magical window--


Stay here! And play D&D for weeks and years at the old folks’ home.


(sing) We built Dis city on--


We don't see a ziggurat yet.


And I say  This is so fuuuu--


I'm gonna take another shot--


It's a very fancy place.


Of all the ten minutes to have him remember, maybe that's not the one to focus on.


Oh, I--


Yes. I want that. I do want it. Yes. Bring it.


Is it casting a spell?


Yeah, 13 total.


Good grief.


Yeah, I'm in the boat.


Watch.


Big money. Okay! Nine. Die! Die!


I command the soldier to start swinging his sword.


Didn't we have to do that?


20. 19. I don't know. It's enough.


Next turn? Do I still have an action after this?


34 for the first hit, and I have the second paladin attack, so if it's not dead, I will attack again.


Guess who's not here.


(exaggerated) Cool.


7, right?


You're not going to fist-bump, or anything?


We need to get to the main event here.


So it's 1d8 plus four. And then I rolled a one, so that's five. But it also says, somewhere in here, deals an additional 1d6 force damage! Oh yeah! One.


This giant lion thing with a woman's head had them around it and then we killed the lion thing.


A bear with two streaks of white hair. (all laugh)


I will let you know if it snaps while it's in your teeth it hurts a lot. I know that from experience.


I mean, maybe, sure.


It couldn't have been.


Yeah. Hector's got Doctor Doom and Gandalf on lock, and he challenged anyone to try to beat him, so.


I will note that Vax feels a slight sense of bittersweet pride at the amount of bliss that Pike just went through. Just a little bit.


I know, but what if it does something--


It's frozen!


You've been playing D&D for years. You know what this means!


Do you buy stuff as well, or do you only sell stuff?


We've almost been dating for five years and we've never gone on a vacation together.


Will do. Again, I must emphasize, no tricky business. We're in good moods. It would be smart to keep it that way.


Okay, good. Then we are probably safe going in. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us. I'm going to see how many people I can cast it on. Every creature I choose within 30 feet of me! So, sweet, it's everybody.


Sir, anything.


It's an action you said?


The Immovable Rod.


Oh, bow's on the ground, bow's on the ground.


And then ten for the second and eight for the third.


I drop Blink.


Percy, we need to have that longer conversation soon.


What was that last bit? Sorry.


You said, "We shall." Have we convinced you?


And a hunter shark has blood frenzy, which means the shark has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have all of its hit points.


I have keen mind, I would call out exactly the right way to go.


Oh, okay. He's in room six.


I don’t know why.


Look through the scoop. Look through it. What do you see?


The Daring Trial and Tribulations of Tary Darrington.


Wilhand never discussed it with you?


As I'm cleaning it up, I'm going to make eye contact just briefly. What do I see? I was curious what the reaction to this ridiculous creature is spilling shit all over her front lawn. That's all.


I'm out of the room, you can't see me.


It is open, darling. Come on.


Very versatile I'd have to say though. Balanced.


Pike got Dragon Aged.


He's got pink hair! He used to live in a cemetery. He doesn't know a lot of things. (whispering) He doesn't know anything about sex. (louder) And he drinks dead people tea.


Oh, yeah, are we still feasting?


I'm going to hold them. I'm going to hold in place, and let's all go around, find Ripley.


I know. I shall.


Do that.


I believe it's arch-i-pelago.


I propose a plan.


I have a rope.


Maybe just one of them. Maybe you've got a patch over the other.


So you mean, shithead?


That's not bad. I pull a book out of my holster and flip to the right page and start muttering. Does anyone want to do anything in those nine minutes left?


You said two fell on the ground, I thought--


I'm going to take a step to my left, and I'm going to drop a grit and I'm going to take a line shot at those two skeletons and make them go the fuck away. That's a 27 to hit.


You started talking at us--


Is it Kara? Dolan?


But I would know that when I saw it. I know alchemy, I know all sorts of materials.


(stutters) Well, I may have--


This is reckless. 29.


Can I bonus inspire myself?


We could stay here forever if we wanted to.


Absolutely not, Vax.


--oh, I know, but all right. Anyway. Thank you for this-- sort of. I guess I have to go to my room and think about this while I stare at my picture in the mirror above my bed.


We could probably kill them all. I'm just throwing that out there.


Do I even stop running?


Hi, dude.


Thank you. Oh that's good. 30 points of radiant damage.


New characters, new characters. New character, who dis? Ah, yeah, okay, eight damage!


Us neither.


How are you going to do this?


What is that number?


How big is it, too?


We need that orb.


(groans)


Do you want it? Just in case yours misfires?


So, wait, is there a gate to the city?


I don't follow. I'll jump on. All right, Grog's got two gnomes on his back.


How is that a pun?


I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself at 4th level. (laughter)


No. There's a frozen man. We actually have a mystery. We have to deal with this.


Are there sides of the river?


This should fix your sleep schedule though, right?


That sounds like the worst thing ever. Oh man.


Relay race. Okay, then I take a step in front of her and pull out my daggers and stand in front of my sister.


Pike, how you doing?


I use Beast Speak on Trinket. And say, Trinket, what are you feeling right now? What's going on? You seem very excited.


Keep going!


Very respected.


Assholes.


Oh my god! Why?!


For the kids at home.


(laughing) I smash my head into the crystal.


Can you dodge, Scanlan?


Come on, Golden Snitch!


It's okay. These things happen. And maybe it wasn't the best time, and maybe someday in the future, we can just reconnoiter and see if we want to make a - just talk about it again, I guess.


That's 24 on the advantage shot.


Jesus, what the fuck?


But we have always been roommates.


I mean, we're in here.


I can. I love you, man.


Do they look rich?


Front door, back door.


He needs as much as you can give him, Scanlan.


I'll go put my nose next to his nose on the glass. What are we looking for?


Can I look around and see if the city seems like it's being affected at all by the no power?


You're very dehydrated, seriously.


Does it blink, shine, shimmer, move?


And we would like to request upon you a moment of your time?


Teleport them there, and then they can get back on their own.


Okay, I'm going to gore that guy to my left.


Keep that robe. (laughs)


We'll send Frumpkin in first.


It's sad.


One, compose an epic poem to commemorate the rebels rising up against the empire that had kept them down for so long. Sort of a force that had awakened. I call it... Resident Evil. I don't know why. Because they're residents and there was evil. I couldn't come up with another name for it. They're residents of the town and there was an evil. That's all. So, I'm looking for a publisher.


Are my thieves' tools broken?


No no. You Levitate me, right?


Can I try and stop the current once again?


Oh, are you going to hand it over here now? Thanks.


Don't stop smiling on my account.


Should we come out?


Secondly, I am going to-- Okay, wait, Trinket's stunned?


Keyleth, let's just wait until Allura gets here. I feel like she might have a calming effect on this situation, an outside eye.


I think I was-- No, it's this guy.


We've got to get out!


You're so brave!


Dude, you were fucking Rambo just then. You were Scanlan Rambo.


Marisha, do one for Fjord.


Oh, who's that?


That was a weak hit, by the way, if you were trying to hit me. See you. Oh, wait, hold on. Are you going to drink this chocolate milk?


Are you going to poop us a bed?


Just choking on Percy's idea.


Beau is going to perch on the rock, and for the first time ever, willingly meditate, while just focusing on the blue that she is now surrounded by.


Looks like they start right here.


Should one of us lick it?


I'm standing in the corner looking at him like, (whispers) what are you fucking doing?


Here the Crafter's Hall remains dark, the Allhammer--


Okay. Then in that case, I'm going to bring my Hex up to the very next--


Well you know, I rolled a nine.


Oh man, that makes me want a Scanlan backpack. Oh man.


Did I get his name?


Wait, what was in that? Was that wine?


That was almost so bad.


I want a bruise, right here.


With all due respect, she is smarter than that.


Right. (laughter)


Okay, that's fair. All right. It's looking like he's going to hold--


Seriously. A wall?


Likewise. You don't miss much, do you?


Do we trust anyone here?


Oh, the thingie?


Yes, of course, Vex, they know we're coming. I showed them the amulet, it was how we got the sigil to come here to begin with. It's fine. We're doing business with them. It'll be good.


Three to three.


Big three.


Tary, shouldn't we leave him?


You rolled for Trinket?


Abyssal, Draconic, Elvish--


We can get Grog back. We've just got to get everybody up.


Hah. You're like, I made it.


Oh, I'm stabbing the guy three times! I'm doing my catchphrase, man. Dagger, dagger, dagger! Oh, he's already taken a turn in combat, okay. So. I'm going to use luck on that first attack and go again-- ooh, and I'll use the first one. So the first one was an 8 plus... 19 on the first?


Okay. If you insist.


Do we want to split up? You want to go talk Orcus?


But you're such a powerful person, don't you think you would be helpful?


So I put the box right down next to me and I put my coat--


I do. I've got a minor left that I haven't burned.


We'll probably get one shot.


Come on down. Let's party.


Should I do action surge?


Ugh, Luck again. Jeepers creepers.


Can she do the stuff they do?


I'm staying next to Keyleth because I can do this from a range.


No, no, he was down in the play zone before!


If she fails, he will know where we are.


Well, he's going to learn. I'm not going to go to the Academy.


So does Yasha, no big deal.


We never understand what's happening, either.


Well then. I'll let you do it! No, you do it! I don't want to-- I take it back! I don't ask you on a date!


Should I try and push him out of the way?


Oh that is such a shame, I know, I almost thought about reminding you to bring your extra--


Because I think if you have sticky fingers for sticks and rocks, I don't think that will get you in trouble.


That's a good question, Matt. I just saw, if we all die or if some of us die, do we have to roll in at a level one, or do we start at a higher level?


Are we down three tentacles now?


Cali? That's a lot of K's. She gave me this scroll of Invisibility. I've been hanging onto it, but I didn't know if you wanted to look at it and maybe learn from it, or something?


Well, I saw beds. I saw six beds, plus a big bed. The big bed belongs to the leader.


I'm using a sword, not a gun, so that's--


Jeez. Hold on. I saw you drop anchor. Do you have an idea of how deep it is here?


This says, "Sew a quilt of fabric swatches, not fabric crotches!"


Zwölf. 12.


Oh, you already get advantage?


Very Old Testament!


I did. I had a vision of white wings, and blue--


Are we plugging up the holes first or are we just watching them?


Okay, so yeah. I'll put it right where you're saying, right there, yeah.


So first attack is nine. There's more coming. Here comes the poison dagger, which is 23.


Reading and writing is good. It's very imp-- imp-- is good.


Or the owner himself.


So this is what it's like to have a family, huh?


Although, that does sound fun.


I asked you tell me what to do. If it was cocked or not, you just stared and went like this.


Secret stuff. Are you ready?


Right next to her?


I would like to take a walk and see what it is we're out to save.


I'm throwing a dagger at him.


Yeah. If the little bell goes off in my head then I know that either that something's coming out--


Are you a murderer?


Oh, my tolerance is like--


Yeah, go ahead.


-- and I bet he could squeeze--


Which is ten, 20. 26?


I have to go. I don't have a choice.


I was ready.


Radiant damage.


It's almost as low as I can go.


It's not you. It's us. We're not ready for that kind of commitment.


We're going to shoot the man and then drunky, smoky Keg is going to pick up The Deuce and he's going to walk around--


Maybe Keyleth can find out something.


Where's the feast to be held?


I don't think it has a shore.


She slips on some slick dock wood and slides right into him.


Jeez Louise, Matt.


I look at Yasha  What do you think? Light or no?


It doesn't say.


I assume none of my Trick Shot stuff is going to use-- that thing's weird.


Because now I feel like it's real important to you.


Yeah, I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.


Well, now he's right-handed.


Yeah, there was some sort of massive pulse of energy, 20-something hooded figures just dropped dead on the spot. A wave of some shit blasted through us.


I shall. I shall speak of your bravery to all that I meet.


What's your AC there, big guy?


Yes, I have Operation Supply Drop, which is a great charity service that delivers fun where there is none to soldiers that are in combat overseas. It delivers gaming systems, games, brings some much-needed levity to areas of high intensity and overall warrior badassmanship, and I'm very proud of that.


Garmelie, show thyself.


And Tary can do it as well. I'll talk into a mirror for a little bit, practice some things that tieflings might say. What are things tieflings say?


Oh, we're getting a looped feedback. I think we're good. And we're going to be doing a special Ant Man-themed Group Hug with a ton of giveaways coming to us from Disney to give away during the show. And then on Monday, Michele Morrow during Massive is giving away a Valve key that was sent to her and basically it unlocks every single game Valve has ever made, as well as every game they will make. So basically, you could own Half-Life 3.


We need three onyx eyes, three ivory eyes, three amber eyes.


I don't wear glasses.


Trapped?


All right. I'll go to my cloak and tear off the Patch of Two Mastiffs.


Oh thank god. Thank god. Is everyone still alive down there?


Fly.


So much wisdom.


27 and an 18.


Look at him flittering around!


You should check out Warmachine.


Traitor!


May I? I'm going to walk up. Move a little bit of the snow and dig my hand as deep into the ground as I can, and attempt to do the full casting of Decompose and see what I get.


Can I ask you a question?


Can I attack the water?


I've taken my hand out. When we were in the Underdark and one of the items that we procured while we were scavenging, and we looted it, and we could give it back to the Thunderbrand.


Where was that symbol?


There's one more 'cause it's three strikes for Frenzied, right?


You're a little dewy, and you don't know why?


You actually become that thing.


He summoned this pony, and then I turned and abruptly cut its fucking head off, and reached in and grabbed its organs, and smeared its gore all over myself, and started screaming. And Mercer was like, "okay."


Good call!


Zadash.


Thanks a lot, Liam!


With a Vicious Mockery, too.


Everything's okay.


Dispel the spell.


Yeah, you so badly want to.


Mum's the word. All right. I'll be back, and maybe we'll have time to talk more books later.


On Tiffany's ship?


High school.


Can I make another roll?


Does that sound like a will-o'-wisp?


I could send an image of a fish or something in there and see what happens, or some other type of creature.


Towards the sounds, yes?


I yank it back.


He does listen to me.


What are you fighting, if I may ask?


I would almost say a shopping district. If there's an abandoned storefront.


22 to me, because, resistance.


It's a hydra!


Is valid.


Way to go, Vax.


I'm a little zoned out.


Like an airtight bubble.


Well, I think we're either druiding our way in or looking for another way in, somehow.


How are your magical reserves?


It definitely saves.


How are we even going to get a beast?


Ah yeah, just going number two! It's going to be a while. That hardtack is hard coming out, too.


1d6. Six.


Reverse psychology!


Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn!


She scrabbled at it.


I’m still alive.


Soulmates.


Yes, yes! Remember in Escape from Brave Mountain? Remember the kindly old wizard who stayed back and tended to the injured and fed them when they were sick with that mystical plague that they got? You could be that old-- Yes. Think about it. Read the book again. And when I come back, we'll talk.


They killed him, they just killed him, Kevdak's son killed him, Kevdak's son knows who he is.


Are you a healer of some sort?


Yeah. Four! He's stronger than me.


Come on. Bring him back.


Ah! Is that cocked? I can't tell if that's cocked. I need a ruling from-- oh, it fell.


What do you grow, other than dead tea?


Catch me! Ca-- what?!


He kept wiggling. You can't really move very much, you wiggle like a little--


(slurring) That's very true. I'm going to remember that next time.


Yeah. I see him. I'm going to take a shot to try and drop him. I'm going to do a wing shot.


I love those.


Okay. I don't do that very often.


If she would like her own room, that can absolutely be arranged.


Hi. We should have asked this before we left the first time. Do you know where their estate is?


Insecurity check.


Grip it harder! (groan)


The orb is floating?


There's no shame in prudence.


Like a costume shop?


That's so cute.


I send Frumpkin up into the air to do a circle around the entire perimeter.


It's both. Oh boy.


Oh! Oh, no, I'm sorry, 20-- plus nine on all that.


Balls. I can see Vex, right? And Shale? Oh, shit. I can't do much without seeing him. Oh, here's what I will do: I'll start by inspiring Shale. I will just step out and sing, (singing) And I will always buff you! And then I will pick a place and cast Stinking Cloud.


Do you lot have some sort of a vault here or something?


We have safe haven-- and please, by the way, stop me if you feel I'm being too broad.


I've got it! (all shush)


I mean, I'm so excited about this. Number one, just because it looks so freaking amazing. But then, he incorporated all of this amazing stuff like quotes and everything that has to do with the characters, and things that mean so much to us as the characters. And he just worked with us nonstop to try to make the most amazing thing for you guys, and I'm so proud of it and so happy.


Oh! Awesome. Cool.


Is this happening? Are we doing this? I'm so excited. Yeah!


Dispater.


Who gives you your orders?


All right, you know what Bane does?


That's not what I was expecting.


Yeah, but he's concentrating on the defensive wall right now.


Yes, thank you for informing us.


I'd rather be here.


She rolled an eight?!?


I get ready. The minute, well, never mind.


What did you have, Caduceus?


Hee! That's awesome. Speaking of trouble, are you going to take her up on that glass of wine?


Make a plan. Maybe make a plan? We don't really have a plan.


Are there any further signs like the feast of people leaving in a hurry? That seems like someone was here and left really fast? A suitcase, or--?


Is there something that if I had an adhesive that I could--


Please tell me it's less than a ten.


That was only you.


Okay. She has to make constitution saving throws. But she's under the effects right now, correct? We've been through this before, haven't we?


Yeah, you, you're the--


I don't know what the difference for a saving throw for Trinket would be.


Mother fuck.


I've seen the trouble behind your eyes all day, not surprisingly, yeah?


No, we found the objects on that cart.


Oh, that's creepy.


Maybe I'll get more food.


Wyrmwood Gaming, if you use the code "critrole," you'll get free shipping! Free shipping.


It's all right, Scanlan. We'll go pay for it later. (all laugh)


So I do have a third attack, then?


Okay. And am I close to the entry point roof? The roof of the entry point?


Don't calculate it, Matt. It's fine.


There's no such thing as family problems being okay for forever.


Okay, great. So that is a 32.


I'm on holiday, yeah.


This Korshad, and the Myriad, where do you meet with him?


I know! I don't know what's wrong with me!


Right now. There could be something so foul on it, we don't know.


Just sneak in?


Where's my Percy die?


Plus! Plus, plus, plus nine is 28.


Whatever you cast on me, Caleb, is like... I feel so good!


Troy Baker? I don't know.


I'll put something forward to the group. If they prove themselves honorable, if they prove themselves faithful and capable of keeping this city afloat, then we will speak to whomever they wish us to speak to precisely of what they did. No more, no less.


20-- 33, excuse me.


Well, if I may. The big fellow over there said that he had some sort of vials that you could breathe air out of. Is that true?


Yeah, absolutely, this is an advantageous moment for all of us. If we can help you and your hentai cult achieve your goal-- [laughter] We'll all come out as winners. This is true if my name is Philip.


That's what we saw last-- or that's what I think I saw when we did a perception check or something.


Do you guys like D&D? What is that?


Yes, decorative.


Not very much -- Ooh! That's pretty good. 20.


15 plus 11 plus 3. 26, 29 damage.


When it rains, the sun is shining.


The tree means worst case scenario.


It's hanging from a tree?


Anything alive?


I don't really remember it.


Do I have to aim at someone?


I do feel better.


Should I go back up to the entrance and make sure we're not being followed or anything?


Hey, Beekus, you just said his real name.


I need my whoring partner.


I've come close many times to going further than I have. You are a charming man. But I respect you very much. And I need to tell you that I can't do the dance anymore. I am in love with someone I don't think loves me, but all the same, it wouldn't be fair to you to think that we might dally, and I don't want to be a liar, so I won't be.


No. Our guards aren't in Syngorn.


Let's go tell the others about everything that we found, except for all the rubies and gold. I'm kidding, we'll tell them about it.


Ooh. Not good. 16.


I might get confused if you call me Lion, though, I'm just warning you ahead of time.


When we kill all the dragons...


Oh, and also I think the song-- Do we announce about the song?


Well, she's researching--


I wait for everybody to pass and I cast all my Grand Columns.


(distressed yell)


I'm sitting wherever there's a lounge of any kind. I'm working in the sketchbook. Working on things.


I'm an expert on dragons.


You should heal yourself!


Blueberry, come on.


A gift for someone.


Howdy!


He vanished?


You know, if you hold two next to each other there looks like there's a million of them.


Okay. I block around as to not look like it's going the same way that I just came from and catch back up with these two. With the detectives.


Is everybody Percy and Cassandra?


What the fuck was that?! What just happened?!


This, I thought, was proof that I was in control of myself. But it's just a terrible thing waiting to happen.


Well, it's weird, because my--


I always take the left.


I go and lift up my cloak and put it over my head. As I do that, another little Twiggy shows up right next to me, and when I move she moves. I go: Look! And we do a little dance for you.


Does she have anything awesome on that we can take?


Right in a line.


I would assume that there's nothing we say that they don't know at this point.


Oh shit, I forgot about Fassbender.


I am, but I'll be back very soon because I have a package coming. So be on the lookout for one to Jester.


That's how we got here.


I'll take a swig to calm my morning nerves and start searching around to see if there's any notes or any signs of anything around.


The accent is on the 'kh'.


d10. Which one's ten, I never remember. This one. Nine!


Oh shit, son!


Sorry. 25.


A thousand dollars.


Because he makes the lodestones.


Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to pull out my broom and I'm going to let the gnomes ride on it, since you guys will sink down a little bit more than the rest of us. Do you want to ride on the broom?


And more guards.


That's okay. It's okay.


16 to hit.


There is-- the pillars are covered when I do the shield-- when I cover myself and put the shield-- the columns have that in them.


Fuck you! Yes! 24.


You are going to crit on Vecna and K.O. yourself.


Let's bring 'em back.


I hate you so much!


They never recovered the body.


I'm going go into town and buy some plates for Laina.


Percy, you're wearing what?


What does that mean?! We don't know what that means! You can't say that shit!


On the roof or the top of the-- sorry.


And the sword?


You've already fallen off one cliff, you're not going to do it again.


Is there anyway I could assist her?


I'm looking, I'm looking.


Like clockwork.


It's going to catch up when you burp really good.


Don't you worry.


I'm here alone. Well, there's... oh, yes. Go peddle your papers somewhere where they'd like papers peddled!


Oof. Oof!


Bit odd. Seems a bit odd.


I'm stuck like this!


I've already got the silver thread out and I am looping it over any open window and by the door.


I'm sorry, Matt. I'm sorry, we love you.


Could we ride, maybe? Drunk riding.


No. Oh, god. Yes.


Going to sleep.


We'll go down, learn a little bit more and begin when you're ready.


All right. I'm waiting on my turkey legs. Just watch. Watch and learn.


That's a bear wearing a Percy costume.


Vax? Vax!


Oh, it's got an arcane lock. Can you undo an arcane lock?


Yeah, I know. Shut up!


Thank you, Joe!


She's feeling awfully BAFTA today, so.


That's very intelligent of you, Grog.


Maybe you can work it out?


I'm rolling really great tonight.


I come out of it.


Yes, straight back.


So now he's extra strong.


Like, the ceiling? Or--


Let me see something. Hang on, because this'll tell me because Polymorph-- you might go out of my range. Is the only problem.


I hold the wand under the table at Caleb's leg and try to do it to him too.


Fjord MVP! Fjord! Yes! Yeah, you killed it this week!


I pull out the Scrying Eye, toss it to Vex.


Oh wait, no! Wait, didn't Clarota take Kima?


I got a blood blister on my arm.


No, she's next to the desk.


We'll get you a new one, Percy.


Know where you want to go?


I make a beeline for the opposite corner. Bonus action dash! Keep going!


Backflip.


Scanlan! Turn Tiberius back into a rat.


There's a bathroom right over there, Percy.


I thought you were, I thought you'd walked up.


But it wasn't in the thing.


Was it a talking mastiff?


I just think it would be funny. Hit pedals like a guitar. You can just change your thing. Fan. Rain.


Did you find it?


All right. Rather than do it, I just grab a hold of her elbow and I shift her to the side and feel through her bones into the lock and--


Yeah. Don't be sad. Your mom is very proud of you, that much was clear.


Taking a cue from Fjord, I'm going to cast Blink on myself.


Oh, I should've tried to-- it's okay.


How was that, how did that feel? Was it frustrating?


Sounds like a sad man right there.


Five. Rolled terribly.


Ew! You can't even see legs!


No, I think we just--


Good for Nila!


Did you come through a ziggurat in Wildemount? And if so, where?


I should have had a Feast or something before. I should have talked to you, and had you inspire me. Yeah, I should've thought about those things. I was really excited about going and hunting things.


It'll do.


Caleb, do you want to stand behind me and little peeksies from behind?


Then double dash.


Yes, I trust your judgment. It is not for me, but I'm definitely all right with anything that makes you happy.


Work that Play-Doh. Come on.


This is rough.


You have Inspiration.


No, that's a ten. Ooh, that's good. Okay, okay, five, four and four is eight, so that brings us to 13, another-- wait, four and four and eight--


We can get these people out. And we're going to need-- and I apologise for the brightness in my voice-- I think we're going to need an airship.


I'm going to hide.


I have advantage. Danger sense. Dexterity saving throws. Total of 20.


So yeah!


A lot. 167.


Thanks for keeping an eye out.


Anything you take on your own time is yours. We're on the clock.


You see? I'm learning everything. Not all at once.


I just run past him.


No, you got to just do this.


But during our trial, we will have a direct line of sight to him, we might be able to get through to him.


How is she tax-exempt?


Don't. Fucking. Let go.


We're literally playing three dimensional chess, right?


From this small stone temple emerges a tall, not necessarily healthily thin firbolg, who is pale and a grayish color, and has a big shock of weirdly pink mohawk hair--


Oh. Did it work, though? I'm sorry.


Are we going straight to him?


What sorts of things?


For sure busy. We could have this guy with Frumpkin making sure that they're busy, if you're comfortable with that. You don't have a lot of a choice.


I don't think I'm going back to Zephra anytime soon.


I mean, that is 100 gold.


Fluffernutter.


Doing what?


She can go now if he uses his reaction.


Grog. I believe we can handle it.


So here is a commercial from The Slayer's Cake.


The Labenda Swamp.


56 for me.


What about it was ominous?


We should send one by air and one by land.


Yes. I'd like that.


Okay, so that is 4d8 against the dragon.


Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'm, you know, simple girl, simple needs. Just wearing nice, baggy clothes, some monk vestiges. They're in nice blues and greys. You notice I have a blue sash around my belt. Got a nice shave going on, little undercut. Looks like maybe I put on makeup two days ago, and I'm like, yeah, it's still holding up. It's fine. I can work with that.


It's a quick thing.


Is that German?


That's an action? Okay, then... I'll stay where I am.


Well, what happened here?


(singing) At Gen Con, I'm surrounded by my friends-con, Ashly, Marisha, Matt, Taliesin-con. They'll be by my side 'til the end-con! At Gen Con. (spoken) There's a second verse; I'll go through it fast. D&D Beyond might drop us tonight, because what I'm doing here, it just ain't right. I'm not advertising their Facebook page, or telling you the promo code GENCON2018 is what it is like I promised backstage. But this little stud's got to follow his heart. And maybe some other body parts. So if they'd want to know who to blame, why don't you just tell them by shouting my name?


I'm going to take his robes.


Or just the letter C.


I want her money.


Sure. Can I put my face in the water? [cheering]


Do you mean, like, permanent marriage?


Cat's Grace.


Yeah, rejection.


He lives in the house in the east? House in the north?


Eight hours, good.


One question is, if these stones are used to pull this tower into the main realms, is there another purpose to them here, or is that doorway safe, is what I'm wondering?


I don't even acknowledge its existence. I am definitely not amused.


I'm not Blessed anymore, am I?


Yasha, you do it.


As soon as it starts roaring, I am surrounded, I have nowhere to go so I pull the diamond out, spin it, and the ice shards start to shoot and I pick it up and I throw it in his bellybutton.


Look, I know you're weird, but if you could tone it down just a skosh.


Oh! (sobs) Buddy! I'm crying and I'm petting him and I say, "It's okay."


All right, I guess I'll make four coins.


Oh my God. I crack boxes like fucking Zelda.


First kill.


Oh, that's very nice of you.


What did we do?


Way to bring it all back.


Oh, this is what people drink?


20 gold, at the very least.


Keep this motherfucker from going.


Then I get a move, still. I mean, I get an action. I'm going attack him! I'm going to attack the Broker!


Ah, that's how you do it.


They're gonna know, 'cause we blocked off the friggin' path! I'm asleep. Sorry.


Yeah. You want to look at it?


I feel comfortable. We have Locate Object, we have a compass.


Is that as far as I can make it?


Sorry, honey.


Did they tell you to gather weapons?


I'm gonna look for a seal, to see if there's a seal anywhere around.


That's definitely a glimmer pot.


Okay, Scanlan.


I know. Maple syrup. They had little Tic Tacs and all sorts of chocolate chips. Lollipops galore.


(French accent) I like to see a chain of ownership so I know that the previous owner will not hunt me down and kill me in the night!


Mine! Mine! Mine!


Right towards this area.


Nine points of booming damage. (impact noise)


Are there any fruits lying around on the ground?


She has a name.


Would you like a glass of wine?


It's locked.


He always does that.


I think you should save--


Cut the rope, cut the rope.


You shouldn't have given them the Sphere.


That's technically true, yes.


I'm cranky because I haven't slept, that's why.


Vote.


Great! Now where are we? On the docks?


Oh, don't.


You guys all right? Is this all on the level? I'm just going to check with the animals that everything is copacetic.


Sometimes you got to get a little stupid, though.


I bet there's a key.


Okay, so we--


I'm here to help. I made a deal with this one. It's okay.


On Friday, watch us as bears? Stealing honey instead of very invaluable books and jewels?


Very high middle if not low upper.


Okay, I'd like to give her a little inspirational song.


You are so dull!


I'm also going to point out, they hadn't been eating the hyenas anyway, so maybe leaving bodies of their pets is not the greatest idea?


But I don't wander too far from everyone else because there's a troll out there, you guys!


Bye, guys, we're live.


He already moved, right? So I don't get advantage for Assassinate, but we'll see if I get sneak attack damage. That's a three, so that's shit. That's a nine-- 15.


Oh, because you can see.


Wait, describe him. Say him again.


For all of us.


In a little bit.


Okay. Let me do a Mass Cure Wounds. I have that.


Yeah. There's a woman dwarf in the room ahead of us.


You could get a 20.


Oh great. Okay, I'll join you.


All right. I’ll be back in less than an hour.


First, we're robbing an old man.


Okay. That is 19.


Okay. Nott?


Yeah, I need it back.


You can turn Trinket into a dragon?


I promise I will not draw a penis on your head.


Let's go see him.


It wouldn't do any damage, it would just contain them?


Pinky toe's a nubbin now, yeah


So do we think that the Clasp is protecting Riskel? Is that what we're assuming?


What sort of aid can you offer, then?


What's your hit points at now, Scanlan?


That's the sound the door makes when you enter Pumat's store!


Just a big old punch. Pummeling hand. Punching hand.


Okay. But it's gone! They're gone.


6! That’s 26 with 6 points of necrotic damage.


Yeah, little peep holes.


Well, we hope that you will find our winters here quite solitary, and convenient on that level. Things are looking grim.


Sorry. This building right here. But in the little gap right here, this little diagonal spot.


I'm going to get to the-- No, I'm going to stay back because I'm a little-- yeah, I'm going to let other people come up first.


Again, Keyleth?


It's cool, though, right?


I am going to try and remove it.


You got to pull a Vega position.


You want me to go down there?


You're very sneaky.


Your coffee-stained artifacts.


We are going to--


Would you mind if I swig?


And I cast Light on my dark dragon staff.


You don't need to get upset with him for it.


So I think we have 4 dead bodies. We're missing 2, then?


You don't just have some health potions in your armor? You can't just plink one out of your nutsack or something?


We're going to have to have a working relationship.


Make all the action figure sounds, Matt!


Oh, I can use my spells to heal us right now.


Yeah, pretty good.


I think that they-- that there's a lot of lying by omission.


Just bailed. (laughter)


It's a Predator bottle opener.


I dropped my Colville meteorite!


Yay! I do Cure Wounds on him again. Stop doing this!


Yeah, but we can't take care of it right now.


I have a fireball. I'll send a fireball over there. Back up a little bit.


Yeah, I believe you completely. That was very believable. I'm going to give you another blessing before you leave, okay?


Is 21! On the first attack.


(chanting) Keg, Keg, Keg!


Let's take all of this out of the house, maybe.


Five gold pieces apiece? I thought they were free, like when you go to an O’Charley’s or an Applebee’s.


Theoretical, obviously!


(vomiting)


Yes, then I would like to fly straight at the maelstrom.


First attack. Yeah, that hits, with a 12?


I have one goodberry left over from Nila that she gave me that I didn't eat. So I'm going to hand him the goodberry--


Interesting. How long have you been working for the Gentleman?


I know. Anyway. All right.


Yay, how many did we get from that?


Unconscious?


I mean, we're going to the Pillow Trove. I support you, Jester, but I mean--


So wait. You're creeped out by water and you're creeped out by fire? Man, covering the spectrums. Yeah.


(laughs) This is craziness. I think there is an upside to Pike and I not having to roll those stealth checks, even with Pass Without a Trace, but if there's anything around that sword, it's going to be up to you to either fight it and get the sword, or get the fuck out.


May I also do the same thing?


Are you sure? We could spend some time here.


She's starting to believe.


I'll fire an Eldritch Blast in his direction. That is only a 16.


Oh, god. Sorry, guys.


Yeah. 23.


Good, we need that.


It is my honor and privilege to be your guest, sir.


Can't you see everything around you? It's all here.


All of us can--


Sure. You're dragging Kash along.


Sure, but Frumpkin is making me so warm.


Ten minutes. I'm going to try. Wait, a thousand feet. That's not very far, compared to where the city is.


Yeah, I also don't want to stick my neck out, but anything that is a thumb in the eye of the Empire, I'm all for.


We all divided it.


You can trust Grog for some things.


An animal.


I thought he was coming with us when we go to leave. That's what I thought.


A very wise man once said that life needs things to live, so.


If you just killed me--


Wait. Where is that in relation to us?


Those are pythons.


Should I make another death save?


That's so wonderful, Keyleth.


I still have an action?


At the surroundings here or what, we're behind a little bit of stone ruins, or--?


Thanks, Batman. All right, here we go. I'm also gonna play Batman. I'm gonna guess that Poison Ivy has the Joker card.


How far are we from the temple? The Alcove?


I could throw up a Blade Barrier on top of him.


He's going to try a thing on her.


(groans) I kind of want to-- no, I shouldn't-- just barrel ahead.


That's where they attacked, yeah.


Pasty, I have a question. Do you know anything about Ioun?


Doty, down. What happened? What's going on? Is he dead?


The Abundant Terrace area.


I'll think about that one.


Can you do anything?


We burst out into the sunlight, and I intentionally trip and eat shit. Scanlan goes flying, boom!


Wait, wait. How much incense do you need?


No, but he's a sieve now.


It's fine. We're all okay.


I don't think we want to stay here--


Did Detect Magic reveal what was glowing in here before?


Oh, when they said it was satanic and stuff? No.


Not yet. Thank you, Grog.


This is exciting, but also D&D Beyond.


Turn and run?


It's not at me for once.


Just raw intelligence?


Guess who's back?


I don't think he has very many.


Keyleth cracks her staff on the floor and does a Gust cantrip and goes (whoosh) to make a big burst of wind in the room.


Okay. Oh! 30.


Do you need more copper? Are you all right?


Do not be sorry.


Apparently. What day is it?


Oh wait, hang on, as a bonus act-- no. I used my bonus action. Fuck. Okay, keep going.


Did you recognize me because of the antlers? That's why I keep them. They're very identifying.


I just want to understand what we are talking about. You know, up close is different than from behind a boudoir.


What kind of techniques, just in case, you know, we have to fight you?


How high is the ceiling in here?


Shit, I should have just punched it.


Oh, I'm so glad!


Suppose we should take a look at what's left of the circus.


I'm so stressed out.


All right! Oh, it's an eight. 12 points of damage total.


My favorite saving throw.


Could I Locate Object on the Bastion of Flesh?


Uncle could use a bath, I know.


Jewelry boxes.


It's very late, right?


Is this a frittata?


I mean I might not be Fjord levels but yeah I can swim.


We're all trapped in that room together, right?


You told me to leave! You took off your clothes. I'm Liam, I'm not Vax, what're you talking about?


I mean, Liam might have to go back to shaving his beard and selling the beard shavings to those in need.


(shiftily) You need some some ball bearings man?


Well, look, so there are people in there that are innocents, right, we told the farmer we'd get his people back and I really want to see if Wilhand's all right. So listen. How do you feel about sending someone in that would draw out their worst?


On the, you know, props. If you die.


Wait, there he is.


(frustrated noise)


Reckless, Great Weapon Master.


Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame?


Natural beauty, it abounds. It all comes from the Sun Tree in the center of town. (whispers) Percy, help!


Soundbiting it up in that.


No! Fjord.


I mean, I'm touching him with it.


A single tear pours down a porcelain cheek.


Just let me hold it!


Finger guns.


I can't get all the way there, so I'll cast something. Shit. It's a prismatic thing, right?


You shot me!


I'll just say that I've attuned to all my old shit while everyone was swimming.


Turn this man into fish sticks.


Was any of that real?


While he's talking, I turn to my sister and go--


And they're sitting about how many feet up on a dragon right now?


You're always welcome.


It works half of the time.


I think, perhaps, you need reverence.


I run over and I pick up Nott and I--


At least distract her. Come on, Percy. That was a 12 on a d12, which is dope.


It's a stack of pizzas.


Okay. I'm going to cast-- fuck-- Cure Wounds on myself.


One small black hole is getting a little bit bigger in the universe?


What happened? Oh, it's my turn?


She's a female.


She sounds lovely.


Do we have anything heavy to put on them to hold them down?


From the other crew?


Yeah. You're quite the word wizard with the haggling there.


Acrobatics? Bless you for an acrobatics check. I'm rerolling that.


I'm going to set them down on the ground.


No, there's also smudge and--


Put it in the bag.


No, like my thigh or something.


Do I have to perceive it? I have a feat that I can read it.


Let's make sure that it doesn't happen, that they won't know.


You seem like a person, and that's great.


It's hard not being the treasurer.


Johnson!


I think I can fly up to nine, I thought.


Can she do this?


We really just need someone to keep them from running through that tunnel.


There would be an effect if it were halved. We would know. You can visually see when someone doesn't take the full damage.


I'm going to spend another ki point to do Patient Defense. I don't trust this motherfucker. Hopefully that's useful.


Potions.


I make sure I take off my hat.


Eww. What is that? Do any of us know what it was?


What is this thing that you have? What is this called? Does it have a name?


She's quite special to me. I think we should-- I think I should go and try to get her out.


This is the stupidest--


Show us where Melrose is.


I thought I was already picked up.


Now I cast Alter Self.


Percy! Wilhand?


Oh, I'll take some of those.


Yes, but she was a horrible person.


Strength modifier.


I know this is well-worn dwarf goof territory, but does someone want to throw me?


Wait, is is Grudge or Grunge?


Going to have some thoughts about that flag, too, but that's for tomorrow.


How much would you part with these for?


I don't know that song, I don't know what that is. I don't know that song. 24, so just 12.


Because if he wants to be a better father to you, then he's going to let this go and not let you do this. If that means him being out on the street, that's my opinion.


Horses would die out there.


(loudly) Yes, because of--


I looked at it plenty.


What the fuck is a purple worm?


Don't cheapen this.


Can I give him a little bit of a boost?


Dude, my abilities are balls, though. I have a five dex and a four wisdom. That's sad.


I'll take watch number one!


Not so I'm blocking the entry, but just so that I'm in, out of thrown-harpoon way, you know what I mean?


Eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod-- So, I don't know-- six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 18.


How close could I get to it, if I wanted to walk straight at it?


That was quick. It was fine, but it was quick, so I'm not sure if that means anything yet. I've overthought this quite a bit and I don't know if you care to hear too many of my fears in this direction, but, I do think about it.


I open the haversack.


I wonder if we should have let them talk for a second. Oh, well.


We're not even there!


There's not much I can do. Yeah. So that's what I'm going to do. Going to run away.


I write ten on a sheet of paper and hold it up. (all laugh)


Yes, it does. Absolutely.


What's your twitter?


(repeating) Action, action--


Mine is.


I want to get up and meet him at a--


But it might not be 60 feet away.


Forget this. Forget this cave. Keyleth, can you do that thing you do where you make the beach look like an empty beach, or something other than it is? Can we camp on the beach instead of going in there?


We have ways across.


Yep, still alive.


Do I have advantage?


You can't smell dead people when you're on the ocean.


Everyone, wait for a second. I step forward a second.


I'm dropping Frumpkin vision.


Let's do that, then. You lead the way. Well wait, you lead the way outside. Let's keep our little schtick going here and then off we go.


It's one floor. Is the window locked?


Can I take a look at that thing, maybe?


The bonus at the end. Okay, all right. So what that is is 47.


No, I'm leaning over the carriage like Hey what about your gato?


Good, because it's not that good.


Yes. Delivered in tiger makeup.


A handle and a candle.


And can I keep my senses aware for aboriginals of the island?


We have guards fucking following us. We have to go find our father.


Here comes that third dagger, man. This one is poisonous. And that hits.


(whispers) They're robbing the bakery right now!


Originally?


We tunnel towards the fucking sword.


All right. I ascend to the top of the ravine and I start meditating, and I cast Plant Growth.


Do I still have my Enhance Ability up?


Right? But I do want to buy potions, as well, and stock up.


Did you just call your fiancé--


Whatever other tunnel options, there's probably other monsters, trolls, fucking undead waiting there, too.


I ate a lot of sugar and caffeine at the beginning of this show. I feel very strange.


I take a big spoon of peanut butter.


I stubbed my toe!


A Revivify coin!


Where are we now?


Oh, it's the same thing! So what is this, strength?


Uh-huh, and they should be gaseous forms, if I'm not mistaken, which means they can't move through it.


What about Caleb? Does Caleb have his money?


Oh my god, that was a long time ago!


How will he know which is which?


One thing.


I'm going to take a few steps back.


Fuck souls, that's a rush.


You don't fuck with Grog's cask of ale!


So I'm taking that shot with sharpshooter. Actually, no, you know what? No, just straight, clean. Yeah, that'll do. 24.


I mean, we just made so much money.


I'm going to kill you later.


Would you want to be the one person that got attacked with the horses by yourself?


I was trying to defuse--


I would assume so.


Yeah, and we had to bust you out. That, and Percy was an awesome lawyer.


He can attack you, though, because he's right next to you.


He has healed 50, though, in theory.


I'm going to very quietly say that I'm going to grab onto your broom and head towards that end. I'm also going to activate the spider climbing boots.


Fail.


What did Clarota do with his hat?


We don't have enough money to pay off the guards.


Why is that their natural response in this town?


How much do you love buttons?


I don't know, Pike. Can he earn his way back in in this manner?


For the love of god.


Think about it. If we could get that stone next to the vortex, he'd be fucked.


And you died. And come back to life. By the way, we haven't talked about that. What was it like on the other side?


No, she's got to roll for it with disadvantage because I'm invisible!


Who needs a fucking magic carpet now?


The golden snitch lives!


Hang on, sorry, trying to do math. (adding) 33 divided in half, so, shit. 11! No, 12! 33? 16!


I can. No, a mouse, like a rat.


I'm leaving probably during the game, to catch my flight to go to GenCon for the Titansgrave panel. Tomorrow!


Why? Okay.


I'm the anti-Wheaton.


How are you going to get Grog over there?


Plants! Look, living things!


You're cheating?!


She's fleeing! I don't blame you!


It's where a hat goes.


Wow, you're so brave.


I want to check out the shack.


He's invisible, but he's a giant stone golem!


Can't use it. It was a seven. 14 for me.


Beautiful. Let's do it.


Contest of wills, staring contest, staring contest!


Hold on. I need to look up the range of a fucking spell. How far is he from me?


Said the fantasy heroes.


Oh, okay, got it.


It feels like it.


As we make our way by, can I identify a low-ranking member of one of the crewmen of one of those ships as they're, perhaps, reaching for a bundle or something?


--Before we circled back around, we hit a fork in the road where we could have gone up and we could have gone down.


That's not on us, though, it's on him.


Fingers going out the windows of the church like Alice in Wonderland.


"It ain't my fault because school was late because Teacher Sally died the evening before last."


Am I going to be the only survivor in this? This'll be funny.


He can make two attacks? This guy's awesome!


She went renegade, folks. She's gone renegade.


You and she of the so-called "Tempest" can both--


I hadn't gotten that far.


But we'd make noise. How far apart are the two duergar standing in that door?


Oh, we haven't heard from them in a long time.


But I am gonna make my shark attack him! The shark's gonna just swim up in his face.


These things!


There's a creature down here. I don't want to make any noise. If you're going to come down to join me, use a rope.


Human jerky? Where the fuck have you guys been?


We're definitely in that shit now. The song? Y'all remember the song?


He's still pressed up against Grog, right?


(whispering) Stop it!


Damn! One turn!


And it's hot?


This is those times.


If that was one side of the throat, I'll go for the other side. Oh, terrible, 11.


I repaid my debt to Gilmore.


But, Tiberius, walk on a bit behind me, and I'm gonna walk up to the edge of town, and I'm gonna chat.


About that money, you said you owed us some?


How often do you get to add that?


Spread the word. Tell everyone to get underground.


Yep. You can't parkour up that wall 25 feet, can you?


A Sam Riegel-type.


I think all things considered, that went rather well. Taryon? Are you all right? Are you all right?


Can I walk up to Nott?


Yeah, I speak into my earring and say zubba zubba zubba zubba.


While we're waiting, I'm gonna throw my hood over one shoulder and I'm gonna undo my sleeves so that-- Oh, the Clasp is back here, isn't it?


Have we seen anything around like another tavern or something maybe a little, I hate to say, more upscale, but cleaner?


Don't worry! That hard wood is the boat. (all laugh)


Yeah, that was rough.


That's Gilbert Gottfried?


Just drink it. It'll make you feel better.


There's Street Fighter, Street Fighter gym bag.


To become underwater sea-breathers?


And plus seven for rage.


Me too, right?


I just need one. You're a woman of the world, and I'm sure you have fine taste, judging by your appearance. It is quite fine, if I may say so myself. If I were a little taller, I would probably ask you out on a date.


You're a really good person.


What's the worst that's going to happen?


Definitely perfect for me. Would you say there's a reasonable bathhouse for someone who's--


I'm taking off my jacket.


Um. Yes? I don't know. It's the weirdest thing, I never realized how much it affected me until we actually were faced with it again. It was good, standing in front of him with everyone else, wasn't it?


What the fuck. Come on, golden snitch.


You get so angry when you're hungry!


Let's see what happens. I'm going to use the cloak to pull it off so that I'm shielded from it if anything happens.


Oh God.


Oh, I forgot to tell you that I never went to sleep and I was watching the whole time!


Thank you. Truly.


You know the silence before the storm?


I’m just saying, I have been known to climb a few things in my time, if you need an extra.


Beau and I are SOL.


And where does your partner reside?


Okay. I'll fly over to Percy, who's on the fucking ground.


I found one.


I'll help with this one. Smelling the air for fishy. Oh, doesn't matter anyway.


Honestly, I thought I was going to be able to last around to the next round.


I think they originated here, but then they moved to where I'm from for the tax laws.


20. No-- 18.


Won't you lose your other spell if you do the spell?


Oh, it's the Raven Queen. Her champion.


We can't fit everybody.


And then as practice, I'm going to become my beautiful angel self and transform into a naked planetar.


Can I see him from wherever I am? This enemy?


It's fun, buddy?


Ice cream.


I'm gonna stay with it but try to blend in with the crowd.


Like a what?


For one half cup?! Is that all it does?


To Fjordie?


I could also think of a spell that would give you a clever Rastafarian crab sidekick.


Does the pillar coming out of the ceiling have a hole in it as well?


Yeah. Still 4th-level Counterspell.


Wessek the Trim.


Yes. Just give us one second. Can I use the freaking Hunter's Mark?


All right. Are we going?


Yeah, I'll go check in.


I can still see?


But I feated, so I'm good!


I'm going to take the rest of my ball bearings and dump them out as we run.


See, Yasha will love that because it's dry like that.


Oh yeah?! Oh, amazing.


Oh shit. Now it's going to steal his strength.


Are there any-- taking that in-- any healing potions or anything in here that we could use?


I have some human jerky left over.


We have to be touching.


Am I able to tell, if this is a giant, domed-in city, are we in a little corner of it, or are we coming up somewhere mid-range?


And I'm just a young girl from town.


And so the McCallisters used a dusty old vacuum cleaner--


Well, that's just semantics. I have a feel about you. You and change. I don't think that you and I have the same plans, but I think they might overlap. I would be willing to help you.


Wow, Grog.


I walk up to Lady Briarwood.


Most general stores have pickles, this is the only thing.


The first roll.


Four, five, plus-- six. Yep, that ends my turn.


You know, I feel a little bit more connected here. This I can-- it's trees. I'm surrounded by trees. This I can relate to.


I'd say about 50 feet up.


So many books tonight.


Grundle?


(quietly) Oh shit.


Yay! 20.


I think I'm pretty stealth.


You try to unjam it?


It's at your discretion.


I just want to make sure that we're going around, passing out all the chains, attaching little hooks and jabby things and grappling hooks.


Can we not-- can we investigate it and see if there's any traps? I mean, how do we make sure it doesn't happen again?


Oh, I always forget that. I'm so sorry.


How do I count these? There's a bunch of sevens. Stupid ones.


I would object to that.


You're hot. You're great. You're good. You're warm. You're finding that stone.


I thought I would bring it up.


If you could start it, I could maybe rip it. I don't know, I'm spitballing here. I don't know what to do.


No, they can only become bats. I read about this.


What do you think, Scanlan? Back up a little bit and shoot a flaming arrow into that?


This is stealth, right? Stealth for me?


Oh, yeah, so you just walk up and take a shot.


I'm going to get some air.


Can I Mage Hand grab it and throw the bowl across the room?


Make sure you have your money still!


Three rooms.


I mean, I am really good at disguises. I haven't flexed those muscles in a while, but--


Yes yes yes!


I don't get an attack?


Would you like to ask it what is dangerous in the wood?


I just had five of the worst rolls I've ever had in a row. That was just ugly. There was just ugliness happening, and I don't feel it's gone yet. It's not the dice, it's in me.


Does it look like they have any wares that they're traveling to trade?


I don't. Is there a thing? Oh well.


Punch her in the face?


May I suggest something? When someone dies in my clan, we know that their spirit never leaves. It just gets returned to nature, which is why we protect nature so fiercely. I have lost people before. I find ways to see them in nature. Sometimes the leaves on the trees-- I pick one leaf and I know that it is a spirit waving to me. Your friend is here. He has not left.


Case closed.


I'd rather not have this.


#BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage


Total shit. Five!


These are obviously too dangerous for this world, and I walk over to the lava. (laughter)
