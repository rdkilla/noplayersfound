Doty. Doty, take this down  In my travels in Anh'karel, I have never seen so many magical items in one place. But then I saw them, walking up to me, and I knew I had met some very special people. That's it for now. Hello! Nice to meet you all. The name is Taryon Darrington. (all laugh)


Take a sip. It's very thick.


Come on Tibs. Tibber-hoods.


I feel cheated. I didn't hear any of that.


Oh god. Okay. I am going to, under the cult hood that I have, transform my face with Alter Self into Sylas Briarwood.


Oh, that's just mean!


(laughs) God, so windy tonight.


Five points of necrotic, (adding) 38. Oh, oh, oh! Enlarged. 39.


That's good! That's a good amount!


Yeah, I know. I'm having trouble thinking straight because there is a blade through my gut and my rib cage. So I grasp the cat's paw again, I don't try to pull myself loose, and I cast Maximilian's Earthen Paw again. Strength save.


I can read Abyssal.


This is the most irritated I've ever seen Matt.


I don't know if I have anything.


Tell Doty to get in.


I still like Yasha's idea.


I think this is a brilliant opportunity.


Run and pray?


That he stops.


Yeah. You said something about a minute before, though, didn't you?


Then go talk to the tree, Keyleth.


K'Varn.


Is there anything on the bodies?


On Percy's and mine.


That's amazing!


So I can take off this negative seven hit points that I don't even remember how I got, probably.


Yes please, you're open for business I take it.


Not perception?


Frequently.


Wouldn't it be so awkward though?


So I cannot see The Devil Wears Prada?


Oh, I don't know. People are strange. Anyone who looks like us, you collect a few interesting enemies on the way, even at her age.


We do have an extra chalice. You know what? I'm going to take the fancy chalice and-- as needed.


Darkvision goggles. Okay.


Something wicked this way comes.


Right, okay. How far away is he? I'm having a hard time seeing. Can I close the gap?


Like, money?


Well, look at where we are, to be fair. I sort of knew we would have to.


Ooh. So it's not like you can ask for a favor, I suppose.


I grab Scanlan like a football for old times' sake and I come up behind Keyleth and I kiss her on the cheek and stare forward.


Does it look like I've gotten far? I feel like I've gone real far.


And I follow Z.


No, they just blow, they force air.


Which is pretty dope.


Yes, Tiffany.


Excellent. You don't mind? I'm going to pull the swords off finally and start getting comfortable out of the performance clothes.


All right. 21.


Do I have a reaction? Can I do that now?


Dagon can live to be 30. She's going to outlive us all.


They took her out of here. They were--


Okay. Oh god! It's midday! What do we do?


He told somebody to pick it up, but they didn't do it yet.


Don't get along with chromatic.


No reason.


I pull out my staff. Do a cool little flourish.


Bathhouse?


Your flask is bottomless!


We can write it for you if you just want to sign it at the bottom.


Did you get allegiance from the Lord of the Crossroads? Right?


We can tie it to the other ones.


You know, sometimes you just have to.


If either one of us tries to turn and do something stupid, or lean a little bit more evil.


Shadycreek Debaters? Side mission.


Frantically?


Jester? I feel your touch on this conversation, is this all accurate?


Oh! You're welcome, young padawan.


But wouldn't that be included in the attacks that I just took? If I can move 15 total?


I'm going to keep my eyes peeled on what I can see and try to keep up as best I can at treeline, like below.


So we know they're here.


Not well. Not very well. It's fucked. He knows we're here. He doesn't know where you are or where I am right now, but he knows that we're here.


I don't wanna speak for you, TJ.


She's not a hag?


Oh, no, we're immediately going to help.


He did the Kill Bill on my hands. I want to try one more time.


Oh! It's where the light's being projected from, I imagine. But nothing in the room?


Grog had the rug, didn't he?


Wait, so it's behind?


You don't need no stinkin' patches.


Pike leads the diversion group.


What do they call those people?


Not bad. Just straight intelligence? 15.


Can I just pull off a scale? A single scale. Is that really hard to do?


And some of your family has left for Kymal?


Kaiju.


I was trying to draw that shit out--


And we watch.


Did you say ten?


Really? Are you sure?


Stretch your legs; hydrate! [applause]


So I can come back with the carpet.


I'm going to squat at the edge of the high crops and keep an eye on the other guard who was walking off just to make sure he's oblivious.


I start heating the metal beams, concentrating from both sides.


I am sorry, Zanror. But I will make it a glorious death. Bring me the gauntlets as well.


I know, it's so terrible! I want to like explore everything here because--


I'm curious to see the library, I just want to see what a giant disaster this is.


I'm good on potions, but we should restock our supply.


Hi guys, welcome to Critical Role, where we nerdy-ass voice actors like to roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons. Oh, and Liam just threw some curses at me right before we started. (laughter)


I'd hate for him to die immediately.


It would have been three rounds before I could do any damage. Before it killed him.


It just came from Nostalgic, I don't even know! Who sent it? It gave me this!


You have the thing in you!


God, this guy. Matt, there's an audience here that deserves a certain amount of death and payoff.


Are you able to handle yourself in a scrap? Are you good with a weapon, or--


Well, why didn't you just keep going, then?


Oh, this is so exciting. This is-- I'm getting out Mertin, they are letting me out! This is so exciting.


How about tea?


I think it is.


Oh my gosh! I put it in the safe place and I didn't realize it!


She sees you having a seizure in the chains. (laughter)


Not great, 12-- no, 14.


We are going to have a picnic on the island.


Oh! Those are two bad dice rolls.


What are rolling?


Okay, she's not here.


And now we have two immovable rods! (cheering)


Did the skeleton and the zombie start dancing better, after that?


And yours is up.


You don't look very good, Mr. Clay.


Had some better days in the '80s.


Somebody give him something to put on. Grog, do you have any more fancy robes?


You wouldn't let her do that, would you?


He's getting Vampiric Touch. That means he'll get to heal a little bit.


Oh, Gamechanger!


Well, shall we away then? We have to go now!


Do you recognize her, Percy?


Listen carefully?


So whatever that was just saw us disappear.


Well, I was just getting in a mid-game hug.


Too much? Okay.


It's pretty great. Yeah. And Matt rolls so bad in that game. It's really great. I am having dinner with my wife tomorrow so I'm looking forward to that. We're probably going to put a whole chicken in the smoker in the afternoon and then I think we're going to play some games. I'm introducing her to a game that I got at Gen Con called Lanterns.


In the boots? We're talking about boots, are we?


Yep. (all laugh)


Does he even know what he's saying?


Did you see any creatures around?


Maybe the mirror is a door.


That is now also canon. Write that in your Wikipedias. Okay, I guess I'll go back down to everyone else?


We will be as quiet as a house mouse. However, if you need us to act, just utter the word "jenga."


Do it, Scanlan. Do it.


Keep going, Grog. You'll get there.


Bring everything in to use so you can just (poosh) to them.


Oh, no! Look at this.


That's pretty great. I like all those things you said.


So Caleb's whole face and cheek, one side is skinned.


I want to fletch an arrow. Owlbear arrows.


We'll get this stuff and head right out.


Natural 20 on that.


Where am I? Okay. I'm going to step forward and to the right a bit. Just sort of joining this little-- like getting right in here. And I'm going to try and shoot, and this is gonna sound weird, but as I'm running I'm going to-- Actually, back me up to about there.


I can stay and count.


They were like (menacing noises).


Okay. What am I rolling? What do I do?


Where do I go?


I'm building a sand castle while they're doing that.


And so we ride!


I got a 25 for stealth and it didn't work?


I have a strong feeling the keg of blackpowder won't do that much damage.


Yay! Let's do it.


I'll tell you in a minute.


Sure. Why don't you take a seat, and order whatever you want, on me.


Should she do turn undead?


Down the stairs?


Fair play.


What should we do, you guys?


Does it look like there's any seams in the ground that would be a trapdoor or anything?


She always gets that now.


So no peeing today. No pee breaks.


We did; we got a long rest.


Don't trust a man who just kissed somebody! That's a man who's saying fuck it.


Perhaps we should at least take a look to see if there was something else down there that was dangerous.


This guy, I've watched turn things into the Jelly of the Month, so I would tread very carefully.


Former business associate?


I've never known a true sense of security. I'm not entirely sure.


I just saw one of those guys that had the thing!


Thanks!


Learn, grow, provoke, consume. I don't understand.


We're going to jump in the shat.


Well, we do have some very inebriated--


Do you think they're really hard to hit because they're small?


And what's our intent in Marquet? To get the next Vestige?


Ooh! That is a 23!


And you have to turn the little marquee again.


Here's what I know. Vecna is possibly, maybe on the loose, maybe coming back. We know that this ritual has been started, and we don't know whether killing her is going to end it or not. So I propose that we start leaving right away.


I run down from the tree.


It's okay, Kiri.


Ja, how far can I get towards this one over there? Even if it means going in the water.


Can you do magic?


(high-pitched) Ooh!


I'll even damage them, I don't give a shit.


(sighs) Get her back home.


Then never mind, I don't do anything. I just fucking fucked that up.


I'm going to use my reaction to swallow part of the spell, so I'm going to take half damage of his half damage.


How many people are left in town and how many have come with me?


The heart of this tree. I think we go in.


Yeah. Pretty much. I think it's a Deck of Fortunate Things.


I'll start a few things, and I'll spread the word. Everybody could really use a bit of a party here. We don't have many resources, but I'm betting there's enough liquor for everybody to get good and drunk tonight.


Knot seesters.


So there's two above ground, but they're behind her.


I was sleeping. Did you notice?


Can I, since I'm in that general vicinity, go 20 or so feet into this hole and listen and see if I hear anything?


See you tomorrow.


I'll grab my stuff.


Yeah, that's it. Like into it.


He's got a safe and a floor.


Does it seem magical?


I can. Can I do that? Right now?


Ogden's had a hard life.


Liam will take over.


Did you notice The Gentleman's face when you mentioned that name?


You did 65 percent of your...


It's a crit? Oh, right, because that's-- well, it's straight dice rolls. Or does she roll dice twice?


That's a mouthful. 'Whore dwarf.'


I hardly know, but I've thrown a baby before. Odd.


Okay, and since Percy is right up against it, I'm able to deal Sneak Attack damage, because there's another one of its foes.


Yeah, we know him.


Is it far away? It's like 15 feet from us you said? Is it farther than that?


Like beating up a Kewpie doll.


Is somebody watching me at the moment?


Pulls the glyph up?


All right, I will. That is very good. That is a 35.


Okay. But this guy-- oh, damn it. What about this guy and this guy? They're within 30 feet, right?


Oh gosh, you are keeper of the giant eagle AC.


January 19th. I'm the oldest!


(whispering) God fucking bullshit. Eight.


I'll point to the one coming from opposite of Vax.


But does it heal you? What do the fragments do? I mean do the soul fragments just like--


Is it full palm-up, or is it Barcalounger style?


Wasn't a one.


Is the desk made out of the stone?


They get killed by hitting them with your fist.


Then we can take our boat.


Then we'll settle this. We don't want Garth from Wayne's World to have anything on our heads.


I play Tim Garrick.


(quietly) He's such an ass.


It was interesting.


Nott, it's just a little reckless, wouldn't you say?


That was the white dragon?


Don't miss.


Well then, you just bring it back immediately. Obviously you take five percent.


Yeah, I'm going to try to shoot an arrow and see what happens.


It was etched on the bottom and I totally understand it.


I go back downstairs.


Fuck! Natural one.


I like this town.


Fucking lava!


That won't be hard at all.


What about these jewels?


All right, I need help. It's still covered, don't worry. She can't see what we're doing, it's covered with my cloak.


Can you set a blaze?


18 plus eight. That's 26?


What? Green lights?


As they're chanting, I'm starting to sing amid the chant. (singing) It's the eye of the goliath, it's the thrill of the fight. Rising up to the challenge of that asshole. (speaking) And I'm trying to send inspiration to him.


Can I spend a grit to try and shoot the rope that's holding that guy in the tree?


The baby is being watched by so many people.


All right, I have nine, eight, 17.


Yeah, I'm all right, too. That's cool.


Don't piss him off.


I could affect a couple of us.


I'll help.


Oh. Dope.


I can be a cloud?


I have quite a few names myself.


Rated T for Teen.


You guys got major damage, though!


I'm going to Cutting Words the mace attack. Right?


For a minute.


I bend over and put my hands on my knees, and--


I was thinking that if we get out of there tonight, fingers crossed, we should probably think about acquiring some sort of vessel to explore the lake tonight.


What's your-- your perception's probably high as balls.


Oh yeah yeah! I will, I have to get it set up.


I know I told them to like, bond but now-- I mean (sighs). No, it's fine, it's fine. I'm cool. I'm cool.


Oh! We have to finish the thing for The Gentleman, oh my gosh!


Yeah I kind of went unconscience.


Hi, Reggie!


Tary, staring off into the distance, shat his pants. Crying, into his poo--


I open the bag of holding and go, Here, here's one brain chunk. And I dump it on the floor.


Do you want any Guidance?


Damn. We're in a tight spot.


But there's illustrations, maps, curse words, colors--


That's what I would do. I will use the Glove of Blasting to fire on the person attacking me.


What do I use as my modifier?


But I've never heard them called a mind flayer, but I guess they could be called a mind flayer. But we call them Illithids. I didn't know they were real, though.


Do you want me to?


Don't open the box!


I'd play with them. That'd be awesome.


So yeah! Check them out. Wheel of Flame.


Well, she's her own person. It's not like she looks like any other one.


Gah, fucking fucker.


It's a religion check.


I thought I was immune to this kind of stuff. (groans) What do I-- not good.


Oh. That's true.


Yeah, I didn't Hunter's Mark either of the guys that I attacked.


Pray tell, it doth hit. That's okay, I've got the armor on. I've got that armor, boo.


Okay, so sneak attack. One.


I'm gonna sing a song of rest for you, so that'll add 1d6 to your healing rolls.


Don't curse me.


Nott is going to hard charge out of the tent. Not at the beast, but across the courtyard. Yes. As fast as she can go, saying: Shit shit shit! Can she make it to that box?


Research facility?


I did. It's only nine points of damage.


Yeah, I was going to do it afterwards. I thought he did two hits backwards?


I forgot that Shaun was Gilmore's first name.


You were?


It's got to keep stabilizing you, I think.


And 17 plus 12 hits on the third?


(screams) (everyone else laughs)


Like Xena. (war cry)


Do we accidentally kiss? Is that what's going to happen here?


Are you left?


Use a d10!


Okay, so I'm going to try to reroll one of my three, too.


We keep going.


I'll take one of those.


We're outstaying our welcome, let's go now.


Good, because that was a natural one. 17.


Didn't we have some water breathing potions? Somewhere?


Oh! They went down.


Who wants to go to a cemetery right now?


Straight intelligence check? 14.


Money!


The last one?


Stupid kraken.


I don't think you've gone far at all, dear. I think you're in the same place.


I don't know, he just seems like a good guy some-- I mean, shifty. But I don't think he's trying to fuck us right now.


I'm back here! I'm back here, I'm back here, I'm back here!


I'm going to shoot at that one.


Jessie, are you all right?


Yeah, they like to make people suffer.


Okay. That was good. We checked that box, so let's go back into the room.


Well-- and I pull apart the lapels of my coat. I have books in what modern-day people like to think of as holster-straps, but there's a book hanging here.


That looked like it hurt. Do you want to be healed?


(grunts, splutters) Respect.


Oh, shite. Not even a good push to get her underneath, just back into one of the tents, or no?


Yeah, like, doesn't that require reading?


Do I get advantage on attacking it because of Guiding Bolt?


I send Frumpkin up into the air as an owl.


Except she's not attacking him.


While she's doing that, can I use my primeval awareness and see if there's anything undead or aberrations or things that are around us that are seeming more active?


Wildmount! You're from Wildmount.


Happy birthday, buddy.


Would you like to see? I'd love to show you.


No, no. Get it. Go do it.


He's leaking from the back of his calf.


Can we all just try them once when we get back to Greyskull Keep?


A couple weeks in detox and you'll be fine.


Wait, that's it? Motherfucker, I thought it gave me a lot more than that.


Your friend and ours, Mollymauk, is no longer of this world, and this would be a way of us saying-- putting his legacy at peace.


Well, it depends on who you ask.


Have anything good on a bonus?


I would like to say thank you so much to the community, to the Critters out there. I've never felt so much love overnight and through this last week. You inspired me today, and all of us, so thank you so much.


No, Kas is destroyed. He turned to ash. He fought Vecna and was turned to ash.


You could try it.


He is very definitely a fish.


Wow, that happened.


Watch where you turn your gaze. It may be the last movement your head makes attached to your body.


Crunch.


He could have me or any of you killed.


It does, doesn't it? And just think how wonderful it will be when you can tell everyone that you sell to that you sold the things that saved the world to Vox Machina.


I thought I would be stronger, but I'm still not.


Brought it back.


I'm going in.


That's lovely.


You just sleep. You need your beauty rest.


The stupid box that we buried still haunts me to this day.


I will never be able to break it.


How far did that map say, when I looked at it? 200 miles you said to Zadash?


Do they have any rune-ish markings on them or anything like that?


Phil, am I right?


On the carpet, okay.


Kill the box, Jester.


I am not going to spell that right.


On both sides?


And what if the machine fails? We need a plan that doesn't rely on technology, I'm sorry.


Where are the best seats?


Left a taint upon you. (laughter)


We want to know how to get into the palace without a problem. Got any advice?


I threaten it down, and say, run. And owe Orthax your freedom. Run!


Grog the Destroyer.


Illithid, all right? Beholders. Large white dragons. I know it's cool to see her flash her boobs and this one sing a song. It's all excitement and craziness and all the rock and roll that the kids are talking about. But listen to me. It's dangerous. You could die any given day. So could I, so could she, so could him. Maybe not him, but the rest of us, sure. Are you really interested in this?


Can I, can I-- huh?


You can use your axe.


Okay, bramble shot again, because I get two, motherfucker! That's ten for my Blazing Bowstring. Oh, Jesus H. Macy. 19, plus five is 24, plus eight is 32, 36. Oh my god, 34. 38, plus ten is 48.


Keg sits down on one of the pieces of furniture.


To--


I start running towards the door to grab weapons. And I'm saying into my ear, where are you? What's going on?


I slap him.


Are there any rocks around us? Any big rocks?


"Sorry I didn't do no chores, Mama. I'm a simpleton!" What are you doing to me?


When you see it, be sure to mark the beast.


We have a UAV.


Right. That one feels, is like super scary-looking, though, right?


It doesn't say what his initiative is.


Ice cream's gone.


Pike, stay with us forever.


I've never glowed before, child.


Ooh. I start popping and locking.


Well, once again, I don't want to leave, because I'm assuming we'll lose access. We don't have access to the airship for forever.


Don't get Gargamel angry.


Eight and eight and 15.


Gern, son of a bitch.


Wardrobe racks?


Our business concluded, we actually have some business at the Cerulean Tower, so we should all, perhaps, head there at this point.


How easy is it going to be to kill this--


I take a ball bearing--


That looks like somebody on the run.


Straight up.


Fucking Percy. Jesus. Every time. You motherfucker.


No, I'm done. Go ahead.


I'm cool.


This is so --


Yeah, I know!


Wait, if our eyelids are invisible, does that mean we can't even close our eyes?


12, plus zero.


I do that with people.


For the rest of the day?


Did you send us to the pond? I thought you took us to the pond.


I feel like you could make it to the top edge.


I'm not there.


The room where it happened?


It felt pretty good when I did it.


Okay. So I whisper something and I move my hand and that silvery, spectral hand comes off, and it goes forward toward the green. I pull my own hand back and get back into the space, and I tell it to push the green flag aside.


(whispers) My god.


Do we mean to be going backwards?


Yeah, you could have just asked if you wanted to meet Brian Foster.


Sounds shifty.


Other one is way high, natural 17.


Oh, go ahead, do something else.


I'm hashtagging Critmas.


Well, I was going to offer, I was originally going to offer some gold if you like, but if you'd like, I could make you a tool you could use with your current predicament. Some sort of simple clawing mechanism for grasping, lifting, not getting caught in your mine.


It's crisp out.


Yes, I have two questions. One of the things I picked up from Kevdak were four enchanted javelins. What do those do?


Look, he mentioned, "Let me give you a trinket in case you all leave so I can find you again."


I make sure Pike's with me over here.


Bigby, save me!


Nice. So 17.


Oh my god, look at all these trees.


Wait, Nott! We're about to cross the area of the button graveyard that lies beneath the waves.


Getting us out.


Is that your scanning face?


Is she always like this? This seems kind of extreme.


I don't say Whitestone. I say, "the place where we sent you originally," so she knows where it is.


What was it Shakäste just said? Get yourself something nice?


That's pretty good, too.


And Ripley's gun.


Is this an attack roll that it's about to make?


I would agree.


No. Can we see if the door shut?


A different dice, too.


Oh fuck. (all laugh)


You're not alone at the moment.


Fuck. Ah!


15 on the strength check. 25.


There's no cake.


It was tied to the hitching post.


Oh. I don't get to kill those guys?


I do not have any.


That d8's very exciting.


Run, Steve Martin, run.


He could be following us for a while.


Sorry! Drinking! I did order two extra. Two extra?


I say we go talk to the Many.


No, it's a bad idea. You're too little for gambling.


I'll snag those.


I'm maxed out on 3rd-level spells, but I still have that thing.


I reach into the bag of holding and I grab five expensive-ass bottles of wine.


The gators come from the left.


The zippers are very hot, I might add.


I can pretend to be a beast.


I told you there was a room behind the mirror.


Yes, okay.


What's your name? I like you.


I've got it. 24.


I'm sending him forward. And I do.


Oh, and I get to do it again?


(worried noise)


(hesitant noises) Will we get it back?


Try the ones that aren't trapped first, please?


(chanting) Caleb!


Is it still dark?


Okay, so the second one, I'm gonna attack him through the blazing bowstring.


How about-- well, hold on.


Then I'm flying eye-level with Vecna. Yeah, am I within 60 feet there?


Well, you're the expert.


Oh. Let me see. I thought that was the daggers.


A circle.


I have no reaction, right? It hasn't come back to me?


Not aerated.


Pike. Ashley. A three-inch figure of Pike is coming for you and a three-inch figure of Scanlan is coming. They're on their way.


She'll alert people to our presence. Yeah. That death knight that seems to be the right-hand man.


Charlie Adler concurs. (laughter)


No, no, no, she's okay.


What say you, Thorbir?


Where are the bodies located?


I'm going to peruse some of these titles, quietly.


I have one more question, and we have allied ourselves to you, that's true. But I'm curious to know, hopefully our goals intertwine, and we want the same thing. But once that is achieved, and it will be, what happens then for the Illithid? Do you return to your home below? Do your people harbor any ambition to move upward into Kraghammer?


Just not reflective.


I'll be performing in a college a cappella concert on Saturday night.


Okay, let's see what is out here.


In a bucket?


She also ain't no hollaback gnome.


I don't know, I mean, they're fighting at Vasselheim right now.


This is Clive the bartender? Hold. Pause. It's something along the lines of-- Okay.


We should go stop the fighting. Right? We should probably let them know it's over.


Can we go in the sewer and see if we can figure out where they went?


You can't see nothing.


I'm being kept alive by some fucked-up weird magic. Before I met you people, I would have never-- the worst I would have gotten in is a bar fight. And I would have won. 'Cause I would have been a liar and a cheater. And now, I didn't help any of you in the last fight. I didn't do anything. The fight before that, I didn't do anything--


We'll pop down tonight to talk to her one more time.


My childhood affection was the only thing that let him live.


We've both seen it, we can't say shit.


No, he can't really do it.


We've pumped these guys for all they've got.


This might be a goblin thing.


Look at the big brain on Gern.


Were we supposed to get something?


Easy. Easy. Easy. We're not going to hurt you.


First one is a 17.


While you're screaming?


I'm taking him underwater.


Abyssal.


Knew where I was? My stealth was that shitty?


No, it was Merlin.


How long have you been providing this to him?


She's so good.


I applaud.


Or advantage.


Do we pick our quarters first? Or do we get assigned roles? Or is there a uniform that we need to wear?


I think it's him. All right.


Actually, I am. How fascinating that you caught me right in the moment where I'm ready to spend money.


I have a question. In my book that I bought for 30 gold, did it mention what level of the multi-level tomb the champion was buried on?


Rugs are the new doors.


I'm a pirate! [laughter, cheering]


So there.


14 armor class.


I have one now.


I start hacking away at the bedding. Just chopping the shit out of it.


That's not really a--


So short rest means--


My mother has never been so proud of me.


Do we need to question the guards?


In a five-foot radius. So yeah...


Anything else in the hallway moving?


Yeah, that right there. That's perfect. Get that tattooed.


Hey, I felt real cool punching that chicken that one time. (laughter)


Did we get any healing potions?


Where was the gem embedded in the doorway?


I literally know nothing about this city.


(whispering) What did the skitterers look like?


Well, fuck me sideways.


(laughing) Oh no, this is so stupid.


Before we go, I believe we have a little settling-up to do?


I'm gonna stay where, well, I'm gonna move just a couple feet away from the guy right behind me, and I'm going to, as my bonus action, might as well give Grog some dice. And also just tell everyone, remember, let's not kill the general, we need him for information.


God, you asshole.


What is the assist?


This is really good. I can also hear you across the room though.


(giggling) Yes.


He's so nice.


Yeah, he's being controlled by it.


Ja! That way! Go that way!


One of the greatest pleasures for me, and I'm obviously a huge nerdlinger, and this is just me reliving high school. When I was talking to Sam about starting all this, and saying hey, let's get together, it's what I wanna do for my birthday, we pulled Travis in, Travis is fucking tight, look at him. He's not the stereotypical D&D player, and he was as snake bitten as the rest of us. Play Dungeons & Dragons, please play Dungeons & Dragons.


What, you really want to do something?


Dragon Age race/class. Ash, anybody that plays?


I'm already through.


And a hard Grog.


Yeah, you did it wrong, see, nothing happened. (laughter)


Ta-da.


It's coming from the bookcase.


Maybe Pumat has a competitor in a town this big.


Check his body for gold!


Dicks, bring it.


Yas, Queen Tiamat!


Well, that's-- 15.


He did! Yeah, he said he didn't have a failsafe. That lying old bastard.


I'm the last one to leave the room.


Yes, I'd say I am.


He could attack Caleb, though. He'll probably attack me. I'm going to stay right there.


Okay, so. Let me double-check. An extra d6 for those two. 15 plus seven is what?


Do I need to roll for attack?


Oh, we can't hear Liam.


I mean, he also had that all-seeing eye on his back, right?


It's very embarrassed pizza.


Do we have the flying carpet?


Wait! Keyleth, what if you just open up the cancerous tree, we reach through, we grab the fucking bow, and then we're out.


And I'm like  You guys! Did you see that! It was really crazy! Did you see? Did you see? They think I'm their leader! They think I'm their god!


Three additional. Do I get plus two for the bracers on that Conjure Barrage?


You don't want to lose them in the ocean. Maybe put them away?


Where are the ghosts? They're just hanging out?


It's such an anti-climactic fight because none of us can do anything.


Oh! Light armor.


I'm going outside.


Oh, Marvel character.


Give me one more inspiration if you can, and we'll see where we go.


It's 60 feet, Sharpshooter, no disadvantage.


Yeah! I wrote down the date somewhere, I know it.


What do you need, what do you need?


We have two healers here. Three.


Bless you. Now you have advantage on stealth checks.


We should go check out this tavern, then.


But the Earthbreaker is here.


I think it's the best way to go.


I don't think there's anything wrong with maybe asking for The Mist. I think maybe Caduceus has a good point, if we can convince her that we're still part of her crew by doing our own recon.


Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't! We'll never make it! Yes, we can!


Lake? No, there's no-- what, there's a lake?


They also have technology, now. They have weapons, guns, that they're developing. It could be a threat to many, many other people.


I just remembered 5,000 gold is being delivered to the keep.


Yeah it should be every time. It's a rule.


Oh. So ten.


Me too! Everybody seems so angry at everybody else. Look at the ship right now! It looks crazy, all these people walking around.


All right. Laina, go back to sleep.


Per person?


Oh, but my spells? Actually--


Thanks, vomit-y brother.


So I used three charges.


I'll be behind Fjord.


Maybe that's fully grown for a firbolg?


Maybe it's not all here. Maybe it's in another location. Maybe there are two other temples.


Do you think I'll have time to finish everything that's on my list, if I roll well?


Seeing the chaos, can I get the Dust of Tracelessness and start trying to sprinkle it behind us?


Yeah, you called it.


What's your last name? (laughter)


Ooh, 19.


We could. Grog, could you do something nasty to his body?


Other than it being black magic?


So wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.


Okay. I go over to it, and I bust out my book, and I start harvesting all the parts we need. Who's got the contract? What all do we need?


What if we divide our forces for now and try to find that handwriting sample? One of us goes and looks for the post, the other one tries to find those public records.


Oh, it's me. This may-- Okay. How big of a jump is it from me to K'Varn?


Druids. People. Wizards. Sorcerers.


Well the Moon-touched Sword, is it small enough to fit in the bag or is it--?


Making fun of someone's appearance is very good.


Oh, and they're at a disadvantage?


So that means he never got his "I'm right here" message out.


We're going to go to Westruun. Right?


(singing) I got a nautical themed, pashmina Afghan.


You heard a (yelp) (impact).


Oh god, we're still in a war zone!


Maybe we should-- go ahead, I'm sorry.


(laughs) Okay.


Pike, be careful.


I mean, it could also further instill Grog being powerful and undead.


No, it's a fighter action.


There were some sapphires in there, too, some blue sapphires, I remember.


I at least know my way in, if we cleared that.


And if we don't complete the contract, then--


We're only six subs away from our first giveaway.


I linger for a bit.


All right, I'm gonna-- you guys can talk amongst yourselves, I gotta run. I'm the only person here so I'm gonna run back, turn off the stream. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.


12 plus whatever. Do I roll again?


That's a lot more than you originally made it sound like.


Do we want to stay, or do we want to head back towards the other three?


Please, take a seat!


Sorry, Mr. Clay.


I'm eating my feelings. (all laugh)


I mean, she's full Mystique, she can pretty much do it all at this point.


Wait, can I fire one Eldritch Blast and make a melee attack?


Yeah, I've been wearing them.


It depends.


It's for Scanlan.


I'm going to use the breathing jug.


Like you'd be a fan?


(singing) I'm backing up in Backblaze of glory! Take me now, download the truth. I'm backing up-- okay, that's it. (cheering)


That still might be useful, even if it doesn't find Grog.


Look how clever food makes all of us.


Shit. Body-glide. (laughter)


She's taking the bow for a spin.


Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two-- [audio resets]


That's very... that's sweet. I love it.


(yelling) I want to get down, I can't feel my legs!


Would triggering it possibly alert them to our existence? Does it make holding up the shield--


As many as it takes.


And tomorrow we're having a special party to celebrate our reaching 2000 subscribers.


I'm going to lightning arrow because everything within ten feet is affected.


"Can you hear my thoughts?"


But yeah, we-- just because we thought it was funny. That's how we choose to spend our free time, is releasing free screensavers, yeah, so go do that.


Do they look like violently ended, or do they look like people who fell asleep and never got up?


More miniatures.


I take my gun. I'm going to shoot it very gently-- I'm going to shoot into the ground to muffle the sound. I'm going to take the heat of it, and I'm going to cauterize it. His tongue, so he doesn't bleed out.


Agreed. I have come here seeking power.


Well, Caleb, how about you send your spectral servant to poke at the little masses of human and see if they start wiggling?


Let's pick up your dad a pie on the way home.


18 and a five.


Entschuldige. I don't know what that is.


Okay, 25 for the first.


Alcohol makes everything better.


Just one dead person that I cast it on.


I offer the satisfaction of Vax knowing that I got them for free.


I will do that.


No, can I just do--


Tempest Fang?


MomoCon.


I am going to move over a bit towards that carriage and I pull the diamond out of my component pouch and a small prismatic ball forms over it. I take my other hand and spin it really fast and little ice shards start shooting out of the side. I take it with the free hand and I'm going to throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher at the one closest to Beauregard.


Ooh, yeah. That always helps. Right? Someone like you, I would probably stay on the outside. You got a little in the crunch zone, right? You seem to have a good range on your weapons.


Pike. Are they dead?


PS, do you know anything about the fields of Elysium?


I feel like we only need three rooms.


Are we trying to talk to it first?


I'm going to pick up that little pile of gold, those couple pieces of gold I see on the ground.


What was the first ring?


The little girl disappeared into the crowd, or did she join a bunch of other kids?


They will be releasing on Thursdays the week after.


Cover me. I cast Healing Word on Grog.


Oh god, no.


I still don't really grasp that you can't--


Oof, what does that mean?


Four foot three.


On all three of them. Three, six, eight.


Okay, that's fine. That's nine points of damage. Then two dice or double the dice?


I'd like to do an insight check before we hustle off.


We could stop them on their way out.


Are we going to the temple or the Take?


Go ask your sailor friend, Fjord!


In the direction of goblin town.


I guess. Yeah, I can.


It's a grand total of 21.


No, Tary!


Marquet is the continent? Correct?


(singing) Can they open it up?


I would much rather you spend time on projects for us than projects for him.


Is he in trouble? Is he in danger?


So I'm quick but not that quick.


50 from whoever's in the lead.


What did that naval officer say to you about the war? What was I hearing?


Oh! Should we move this map?


Can I see him at all?


21 for me.


Yeah, because I can't do anything else, right?


We totally do.


New robes, too.


Binder rappel!


I was also on the beach.


Sweet, then they end their turn!


Attack? Where? How do we know where?


Is this normal? What's happening?


That's ten, isn't it?


That's not great. That's a six.


Are you responsible for these pyres?


The Shore Shanty?


Oh, can I have some?


All right. Spend it.


He makes what?


Time for a family reunion, Grog.


Less than that.


I was going to try and save you.


So they don't have something up? Do they have a hood over their head?


Two more, maybe I can-- 14-- Okay, well, the second one I rolled a 25.


There a great little cave alcove here, perfect for peeing in.


No, I didn't, I came to make sure you were all right, and is everything all right? Have we heard of any other attacks or incidents?


We'll be able to get back in if we need to, we just want to make sure that no one can wander in and out of here without making a bit of a ruckus.


It's a fair question.


Yeah. Just over it, huh? Plus, it'll give us time to leave? Maybe things will change by the time we come back? Or maybe not. We'll see. Never know what happens outside.


It's not in this realm.


Well, it depends on how much I want to do with it. I want my cat back. But I was in the realm of 15 or 20 gold I'm going to spend here today, if they have that much.


5000. We have hundreds.


While they were having that conversation, I'm hanging back with Fjord, if you're cool with that.


Everything hits.


It's really awesome. You guys should-- we should go. This is like our cool hideout.


I could be worse.


Red oven mitt, who's got it?


That's gone real well for us in the past 24 hours, but go ahead.


But there's money involved, so there's incentive.


Smart to not test your fate, boy.


You can shake the ground, though.


I look to the crater in the ground and I go: Whoa. And I would like to rage. Can I, in 50 feet, get to--


I want a traditional dwarven breakfast.


Cousins?


We keep trying to tell her that, don't we?


Hey, that's me!


No. Yes.


Maybe don't touch it.


I do have a sword, shit, I'm the worst at this!


Yeah. I'll bring it.


Okay, something along those lines. And then he said that it was the guardians of this city that brought this upon Emon, and that he has control. He called it like a new order.


Big damage.


What's at 18?


How's that charisma bonus working out for you?


All right, let's go see it.


Keyleth's got a cloak. Pike's got a cloak.


It's a surprise!


Surprise round, get as many range and AoE spells off as we can?


The seaward side?


Okay, okay, okay. Come on, Gil. Don't fuck me, Gil. You fucked me, Gil. Four.


Is that where you have to roll backwards?


(whispers) Okay, maybe if I get over, I could hold the other end and help people.


Hey, I’m in a lot of pain.


I just want to go. It will be okay. We have two firbolgs.


I tuck that inside of my belt-beard. Just so it's nice there. One little part of it just flapping out.


Yeah, you have it.


Time gets a little wonky here.


Up, up, up.


You keep your house, you keep your things, you keep a little bit of property to manage.


Only one person would know the entire name of Percival de Rolo.


Plus-- that's shit. Shit. Luck. 11.


I cast Pass Without a Trace on everybody.


We don't know that he rolled shittily.


Watching his kids!


First thing in the morning, you're like, (sarcasm) "Oh, I know, it was amazing. Tell me more. "


And he comes and he's over here!


(laughing) Sneaky, sneaky Keyleth.


Wastehunter. That is 15 to hit.


We're just going to sleep? Surrounded by vampires, we're just going to sleep surrounded by lots and lots of vampires?


Doty's book.


You have a friendly owl.


Am I still big? How much longer am I big Beau?


We don't get to say goodbye.


I can understand taking the easy way out with the power that you have. It's what I've done my whole life. I just don't know anything else, though.


Yes, that might be very strange.


Oh, 33.


When she was yelling on the other side of the portal, was there any sound that came between the two? Between the portal? Nothing?


Clarota's with us.


I think this is our third or fourth time together and I really appreciate the incredible support you've given us over the years, so thank you.


Because we are many.


Yes, okay. Then that's 2d6. That's 12.


I save Nott and I'll fall.


I didn't bring anything because we decided to hoof it.


I don't steal anymore. Much. Sometimes--


Maybe not to Dolan's, then.


Ten feet? That's close enough, I guess. I'm going to take a couple of steps back, and I'm going to do a fire shot and an ice shot with my last two shots.


Phillip!


Ah, another time. I'll raincheck you, bud. Do we still have any more orc or boar parts?


Did I just waste something?


That's a natural 14.


And Kash. And I took his last blood, and I heard a threat, but I didn't make anything of it.


I just get the leftover mashed potatoes from breakfast.


Tequila. Yeah, so that stuff.


Wait a minute. But not The Gentleman, though.


That's never going to get old.


I-- not--


I pat him on his little cheek, and I say wake up: Theo. Wake up.


I'd like to think so.


I grab again. I grab again. I grab again. I grab again.


She will be able to feel it.


Constitution saving? That would be a negative one? No, not a negative one. Add negative one. That would be 15.


No, you did wonderfully.


No-- That feels like a trap to me. That feels like the sort of thing I would do if I wanted to shank someone in an alley.


Yeah, they're incapacitated. Their speed is zero. But if they take damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of their stupor, then they (confused noises).


Same exact move.


I don't like seeing lights at night, it wakes me out of my dream state, so--


The beds, was that like lying down on a saltine for you?


I just-- you know what? Actually, now that I'm thinking about it. (all laugh)


As they're leaving, not wanting to get left out, I fly down from the air and land in my sister's hair and like a cat (growls) into the top of her head five or seven or 12 times.


Erika and Hector!


Isn't it still slowed?


12. So that's 22. And a ten. For a 32.


Yes. (all laugh)


So that is (counting) 19 points of health.


I'm only wearing the pointy helmet, Percy's ascot, and his glasses.


Is it just seeing someone throw up or is it also hearing the sound that makes it worse? If I just went (retching) does that--


Yeah, that's doubled. It was terrible.


Don't you need to know where you're going for that spell to work?


Oh! Did you come from Zadash?


Does that mean it's got a baby somewhere in the woods and I just didn't know about it?


I'll Counterspell.


And I would know when it's right on me because I can sense that much, at least.


Come on, Laura.


It's only a 12. No, 14 to hit.


Lord Briarwood is a vampire.


It's blessed from the Mother herself, from one of the graves of the less scrupulous families of the north. Good for muscle tension, I find. Grew it myself.


His flight landed. I got a text. His flight has landed. He's on his way.


Yasha is still.


Not in this game.


I light some sage.


My insight is so bad.


Wait, wait, (vomiting noises) I'm ready.


Maybe not, though.


It's the one that Scanlan burned.


No, I'm terrible. It's tiny.


Metamucil?


Well, you should.


It never got her to zero.


Grog is on the ground? Oh, he is on the ground.


Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just saying.


They'll get their return back if he's High-Richter afterwards, though.


Trinket, attack the thing!


Okay. Does Unseen Servant have any mass?


The night's still young.


I am going!


That is the end of my turn. Yeah. I am now going, maybe I shouldn't have done that. (laughter)


Sure. Go, slaves! Walk! Forward! Like you do!


We haven't done that in quite a while to be fair.


Let's not blow anything up yet.


Shooting him in the face. Fuck it. And my gun jams. You did that!


Can I approach the water fuck that's on Mr. Clay? And I will use Booming Blade against it.


Oh boy, that's not great. 18.


Oh! I could, if I didn't put my Hunter's Mark on it, but I'm going to Hunter's Mark him before I do that.


In the hallway that leads to the first chamber.


It really is, but you don't have to look far for a friend. Anyway, I'll leave you to it.


Cliffhanger. Beautiful.


I have one. She can have mine.


Can we see Wilhand anywhere?


Well, I'll leave you to your work, and-- love the decorations. I'm considering the offer and I'll have an answer for you by tomorrow morning.


I haven't spoken to you. You're very big.


We steal horses. We make a nice little bed for Yasha and lay her down.


Travis just aged a year.


Well then we should roast her.


I mean, I know I'd like a drink.


But unfortunately we have no coin. However, we are willing to offer many gifts.


We can help them by killing the dragon.


It's okay! Don't worry, they'll like you! They like me!


Not necessarily!


Can Lionel and I commune together and do bonuses? Can I be like, can you call your ducks?


I look cool!


Exactly. This will be "Mom's Emergency Fund."


We break it.


Guiatao Clan.


Caleb is going to sneak off while everybody is involved with this.


Grog was right! He's always right!


I'll take it away!


Ah! What did he touch?!


(clears throat) that is my turn.


That's like only one of a couple that I know. All right. You get to come out.


I'm at the Slayer's Cake. I am making blondies.


When I say, "Tary," you say "What!" Tary!


22. To jump across.


Yes it did.


Speed is 40.


Third shot's going to be a sharpshooter shot.


Yeah, no, that I remember. Yeah, that. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.


Oh, he probably doesn't need my help. I get advantage on all dragon things.


And I would like to attack, the first two times, at the big purple dick that just came out of the ground.


I touch him to see if he's real.


Because you put your lips to it.


I'm going to go, with me and you Molly on the other door.


I'm picturing the anvil right in front of me and he's off to the side, right?


Sure. I imagine he's probably a little jumpy of people if he owes money and that sort of thing. That can make someone very mistrusting. I would hate to invoke your name in front of him, but--


Because I'm covered in blood?


Oh, I'd be 70. When we started, I was 69.


Yeah, describe them.


I go and sit down next to them, putting my knees up, too. This whole thing is really messed up, right?


Did you get to go to the park, did she read you stories, did she do the things that parents do?


If everything goes wrong, we meet back here in two hours. Otherwise, check in every 30 minutes. Do we need a code word?


I wouldn't know anything about her, so yeah. I blast.


(laughs) Any other questions for our guest, guys?


No window in the door and the door is locked. Okay. I'm going to start gently meditating on breaking the window, or opening the window if it'll open.


It's done. She cast it. Let's go on.


Sure is pretty.


I don't think I've ever seen Percy giggle before.


He is not the strongest.


It's okay, maybe you just feel that way because we could all die, so.


Oh. But you can run it over and run back.


No, wait. 13. What?


Can I use my perception to see which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest?


Is the cellar door hidden from view of everything or is it out in the open?


Spell attack bonus-- Okay. 27.


Okay, I'm going to reach out and do an Entangle spell right under her.


Yeah. I want to buy some holy oil, or get some holy oil from the church, or something. (laughter) Where do I get holy oil?


I have thieves' tools because I'm a thief now.


Oh, I'm the Thanksgiving playlist.


It's all right. We'll get it and we'll figure it out when we get there.


Do we see anything outside on the porch?


Okay. Uh-huh.


All right. Natural 20!


Oh, we did take a long rest.


I'm pretty familiar with it.


I’m bringing a swath from one of the -


I know. Eight.


Yeah, no more Grog.


Could I have had Trinket run over to the tree where Percy is?


Five plus two.


They can just obliterate anything?


So is our mission to take money and leave?


Yeah. There's an invasion box, a quest box, and a power box, but we don't have that yet.


How long are you going to torture yourself for?


Groon, if Vecna attacks here, he'll bring undead.


Come on, goliaths and Herd, please roll better.


I can't do anything, you said.


In the water, going up our noses?


You're like 17 and a half here, right?


You've had opium this whole time and you never...


Are they magic?


(whispering) Oh no.


You cannot spy on a thing, as far as I know. You can spy on a place. You can spy on a person.


We saved him, though, and we told him to come here!


We’ll see what you want -


Lovely to see you.


We're just trying to achieve one thing, and that was hopefully to get some eyes on our good friend Gustav, if we could.


Can I pull him? Can I pull him out of the way?


There's only two! It's a coin!


Yeah, and if not that, then the message left in there.


And I just give her a-- (grunts) from the corner.


It would.


I am? And Keyleth has already done her fastball special, that couldn't happen again at the moment?


You're going to introduce us to your little friend there?


Two? I thought it was three? No?


That doesn't count if it rolls onto a phone?


Like when lightning hits sand?


Yeah. You know, so when interesting and different people would pass through my hometown I started making some connections, started getting involved in some mainly illegal trading.


Ways off.


Tourist, I'm a tourist.


What? I don't understand. How do you do that?


Listen, the ocean will be here and we've got plenty of time to come back and fish, all sorts of stuff.


Yes, how'd that work for you?


If I know anything from my time in the criminal underworld, it's these people always have secret passageways in and out. We could do like a wide walk of the perimeter, see if we find anything out-of-place in the forest. See if there's a path, and if we don't find anything, make our way back into town. Look for a hired hand.


No doy, Mrs. Henderson! You said, "Take out the trash," and it was the stinkiest thing in the house.


Okay. I'd like to move forward and finish off Phil.


8d6.


I'm going to take some food and feed it to Lockheed and roll for my animal handling for the day.


Abandoned.


I think he's going to be on. I think. Pretty sure.


See, this tree can squash me like a bug. If it fell on me, yeah.


Magic guns are dangerous.


Okay, all right. I'm not stealthed, but I run over by--


Does it sound pleasant?


We learned it from watching you.


So how do we go there? Would they kill us?


Come here!


I can talk now? Okay.


Anyone want to check the other cages? Make sure it's not the same thing in each?


Not for you, Beast Mode.


Debatable whether it can understand us, but perhaps it can.


And you took 28 points.


See, we're not the only ones. We felt like something's been missing.


That was so crushing, to see the number on the die.


Yeah, no, what do you want a tattoo of, like a picture of.


A dead one.


Iron?


Yeah, I can do whatever we want. Do you want me to knock on the door, is that what we're trying to do?


Why, is that bad or good?


It's fine. It wouldn't have done anything.


Yes. I still don't know what that means. But I am actually happy to see you, milady.


Is there anything else we can do? Is there anything else I can do at this moment?


Would we be accepted there? I've done some things in my life that are less than heavenly.


I'll go with her, just to accompany.


Yeah, I have just enough incense to-- yeah sure, let's make an octopus. Cat-shaped. An octopus-shaped cat.


Oh, no. Okay, it definitely hits. It's plus seven, 16, 23.


Yeah, he kept it with us.


They're flying off the shelves!


It took a while. It's old needle-and-hammer style. All traditional.


Yeah, you're right. I'm going to go sparkle stone.


Or the Pillow Trove.


I don't want to fight the genie guy. I'm going to go for Algar.


K'varn.


I'm waiting to hear Vax go to his room.


The pleasure was all mine.


Beefing up the twins.


I figured. Okay. That one works for the circus. Do I look like I work for the circus?


"Now, I do it now?"


Well, it could do that, it could also-- I don't know anything about magic, but I assume it could burn us.


I'm going to gaze at him, as a professional gazer. I'm going to gaze at Taryon. And just allow my head wound to just bleed out.


I rush into the fire!


Can't we put them on a wagon? Can't we like put them on a wagon, down and like--


Aw, you rolled a 19!


We actually had a cleric with us.


Operation tree rescue.


It's a gorgeous box.


And 19 on the third.


Days. I was a bit out of it. It's hard to remember. I wasn't speaking, really. Do you have memories from your childhood?


Well said, Matt.


They need to crew that ship.


(singing) How tall is my firbolg? Seven feet?


No, Yasha stays with our First Mate, Gallan--


He'll get up. His feet are free. His legs and feet are free. I'm picturing chest and arms.


He has to make a strength check?


Do you speak Common?


It's standard carny practice to be able to fake boils and stuff with a disguise kit to leper up a bit?


Wow, fucking pay day!


How much is the weasel again? How much for the weasel?


You can say no.


We delivered the horn of Orcus to the Platinum Dragon.


He's dead.


Can I do an insight check to see if he's lying about that?


I am running at him and stabbing the shit out of him.


I do. I could attempt to see what happened. What do you mean, there was no plant life?


We have a bakery.


If that's what you want, Grog. I don't think that's a bad idea.


Powder, ball, make ready, fire.


That is a really good accent.


So both of those hit. 2d6 plus three. First one is eight. Plus ten. 18 fire damage.


I plant my hands on the sides of the wood and start transmuting it to iron.


I Prestidigitate all the crap off.


Mind flayers! A beholder! Have you heard of a beholder?


Yeah, old news. We've done it before, we'll do it again. Hey, do you want to try jumping around with those boots?


There's no point in worrying about things you can't change yet, Caleb.


Totally forgot I fell asleep!


Me, maybe, because we saw it.


What do we need to accomplish here in town? Is there anything we need to finish, or do we want to pick our next destination?


It could be someone under the table.


Just focus on the mission.


To get out.


I'm staring at Vax.


You want to fight it?


(laughs) "Can we loot the mist?"


Thank god for the buff.


As big as Keg?


Magneto helmet!


Maybe the dice gods really want the charity to do well.


So that's 14. Oh, no. Arcana?


Oh, Percy!


We've already been to the general store.


That's ten.


Jesus! Oh, I forgot you were there.


I can lock her down.


We should've played our theme music over that. (laughter)


Good pitch.


I haven't learned that one yet. Some day.


Yeah! No, I like this idea. This is really something we can roll with! Yeah! He should miss us! In fact, he should be coming to beg us to be like, I miss you! You're so cool!


She's poisoned!


It's a really powerful pixie fight.


Yeah, we should go have a look tomorrow morning.


Why is he doing this?


Are you out? You're outside of the room.


Are your hands okay?


Strength save against a 20.


Okay. I got them.


I think we're going to have to.


Okay. You know what I'm saying?


Second roll was 11, 19 total.


Not even paying attention. BTS Monday! Marisha Ray!


We still have to go over and in.


Oh, what does it do?


What if I just send something that's on fire and I throw it down the tunnel?


Otherwise, I’m running down a hallway for no reason. I just don’t move. I just stand there dumbfounded that Pike is naked and cut to shit.


That's right! Because we are detectives and we're really good at solving cases. She's my partner in crime.


It's unique, I'd remember.


That was cool. Vax, you have a very different relationship with your god, but-- awesome! That was cool!


Feed Lockheed.


Murderous fish men!


That would suck.


No! We walk in. He's beckoning us. Let's walk in. I'm walking in.


It's coming to get us. It's literally coming to get us.


I did. 8d4?


What kind of dreams?


Nine. Not as much as Yasha.


Not looking friendly, neither.


I literally told you about that one minute ago.


Do we have to get in disguise again in order to leave?


Look out!


I stand up and kick one of them.


Yeah. 34 points of damage.


This isn't happening. Fuck with me. I'm so excited.


You do have 1,000 ball bearings, I remember that. We had money. She bought a lot of fucking ball bearings.


(knocking) We're done. Let us out. Guards!


So, 46 with the keen dagger on the guard at the door.


It would help me and Taliesin see.


I covered my hand in ink.


Are we with you?


-- things that dangle in front of their faces?


I would like to use my movement and my bonus action to run. I want to beeline towards the rogue. How far do I get?


She just goes  No problem.


You can hold.


She's got the bruise on the--


And then I add that? That would be a 29.


We can cover you from a roof.


I'll bring you back something, Yash.


I'm trying to hold it.


I can take care of this, if you'd like.


Yeah, how do we get Grog out?


We could leave them here while we go do our business.


Kraghammer has another performer, and not a very good one.


The Undying King...


Did you say how far to the bottom it seemed?


It's next on the list.


You understand.


I need more than a hundred.


You killed Percy.


"If the money's right and if it's not stupid" is a good philosophy for this group.


(sing the Super Mario level complete music)


Your face, my face.


Can I double back into the performance area and see if I can find that little girl that they're looking for? Before they do?


Grog, I've heard that no one in this town wears a beard.


Yeah, it was timed, there was an hourglass going off. It was us discovering D&D really for the first time. AllWorkNoPlay, all one word.


What happened last time?


Sweet. 14.


That's a griffin.


We should probably leave.


Yeah, I can't ride; I've developed a tour walk.


Yes, 2d6 plus five on each one and the--


The ice is already melting.


Oh that's right, I've got that, at the top of my turn.


Does that jive with your hometown, though, Kiki? Dressing up?


I had a thought--


I don't blame you, dear.


Trinket is the bomb.


You go ahead and suffer!


I'm very ready to go. This is lovely and everything, but I've had my fill.


I wonder--


Let's give it some time.


Anyhow, I've got a map, so let's use this. Stay on point here.


All right. Very smart, as always.


Oh good, I was wondering if--


Also, does each portal go to the same place, or do they go to different parts?


I elbow my sister, then dive into the pie.


You want them to get there in one turn, right?


-- and slap him on the face a few times.


The cloud went in the wall?


Although that would be what I would imagine Jester saying.


Okay. So we Tree Stride back.


That'll work; that's fine.


The two trammels are in? He has one more legendary save.


No, no, no. There's definitely something in that stone. It looked at me.


Hey you guys, don't die!


If they don't know what the monster is, and we have a perfectly good manticore head--


What's that sound? Is somebody popping popcorn?!


Plus whatever.


Yeah, but we still defeated her.


See if we can knock one out.


I think going outside is a good idea. Go outside.


What have you been doing after school? Honey?


Like you'll be a really good talker?


Okay. I cast--


But all the villagers that aren't in armor are still in town.


You did your hand signal for Arnold Palmer.


I thought Trinket swiped the Hunter's Marked guy, though.


Okay, I'm just going to sing a little ditty to Pike, just to give her a little inspiration. I'll just do some pelvic thrusting-- a little (guitar), that's a flute, by the way. (all laugh)


Oh, okay, so we can sort of avoid--


I'm going to take a couple steps, if I can, like up on those rocks next to Yasha is it? Yeah.


For the lulz? (laughter)


He seems to be pretty powerful and all-knowing. I'm pretty sure he probably knows we're fucking here.


Little brains.


Earring talk.


Everybody drink, yeah Laura!


I float down.


Then if I pull it up?


28 points?


Okay, I'll wear the red, but maybe you could be there.


Can I hit the gem, please?


Yeah! Isn't that cool?


Animal Shapes last for 24 hours.


You know, we should drink to old stories of Brinjay.


Well, they're the Mighty Nein. (laughter)


Man, to think I almost didn't Skype in tonight.


I'll use Uncanny Dodge for the first one that hits.


Okay, well, let's go by the rules, then.


And, like, stack them.


That's what I based this whole plan on.


I pull him up top.


It's a stupid name.


Can I look for booze?


Maybe orcas, but they're not whales, right?


What was it called again, Ashley?


And I think we should all go back-- we should go to the second floor.


It's the work of those adventurers.


I thought we were invisible. We're invisible.


The birds were up in the air, though.


Rock beats scissors.


You killed it.


Okay, I guess I'll try to shoot it, then.


Yeah, definitely Brad Pitt.


It's a Nickelback tattoo. (laughter)


Nothing is ever what it's supposed to be.


Whom we kind of forgot was with us. (nervous laugh)


Whack with the stick.


Oh, you piece of shit.


How do you spell that?! Doty, take that down! Erinyes!


Yeah, late morning. Can I just take a moment with my goblin friend while they're sleeping?


And that's Sneak Attack because he's occupied. That's 11 plus--


Yeah, I'm sorry, the rest of my movement. So that's 20, 25, 30.


Oh we did?


Here's my question. Is this all happening still over top of the bone pit?


It's big. 5th-level spell.


Never happens to me. I'm usually a 3/4 cover bonus.


Can you help us find a book? It contains an Incantation of Isolation.


Did you say moving?


Castle Greyskull. Some know us as the S.H.I.Ts.


Well, my job for most of my life was to talk to people. Well, it wasn't to talk to people; it was to listen to people. I've listened to a lot of people.


I'm going to run this way, as far as my little-- well, so I can still see everybody and the action.


Mm-mm.


We're going to shat in the chat tomorrow night during the show.


Yeah, you know, Tary, there's something you don't really know about-- we've just-- I mean, it's really complicated, it's hard to explain to you, you're an outsider. But we have just lost someone very dear to us. It's very complicated. And maybe we're dealing with shit that is hard, so I'm sorry if we pushed you too hard. I think there was benefit to be had from what just happened, but we're in a shitty headstate. A dear friend is gone, so, apologies.


No, it's straight. Because you cast...


15? And I'm going to add my inspiration from him.


So accurate.


Now your hair is extra fluffy because you did it.


No, I have never been rejected by a tree. Most trees like me. People don't like me, but at least trees do, except for this asshole.


We're going to crawl under his bed.


I'm going to cast Detect Magic because I have a suspicion that she has something on her, or perhaps the orb in her head. Then I will down the potion that's in my pocket as a bonus action.


Okay, so that will be-- that's a good date night to look forward to. Let's go home, I guess.


I really should check my email!


I don't know what you're talking about. And I walk away from her without saying another word.


(straining) Can't remember. But I think I might be like this because of him.


Or as Liam calls it, Sa-REN-rae.


Keyleth? I run over and I give Keyleth a big ol' bear hug, squeezing maybe a bit too tight.


Well, is this creature willing to make a deal? Because the white one belongs to me.


And we just left him there?!


We're here again?


I will sing to him, (singing) You had a bad day, you gettin' knocked down. I sing you a song just to turn it around! You say you don't know, but please don't die. I'll sing you this song and maybe you'll go for a ride. You had a bad day. (speaking) I don't know how that song goes.


I so want to get some payback, but I shouldn't, right?


I'll pay for that.


No, I'm still going to shoot and you're going to be ready with jav.


I'll take Kiri, give me Kiri. Come here, little Kiri. My father won't hurt you anymore.


Okay, ten.


If you can, Caleb, that would be quite remarkable.


I loved it so much.


I know! I also like being a human.


Yes, to take that seat. To enact the change that the people need.


Trying to disintegrate me to death?


Is that my spellcasting--? No, it's a DC 15. It saves.


We're like a bad speed dating session. Holy shit.


Here's a laser pointer if you need it.


Yeah. (coughs)


You may be my new hero.


Yeah, it's called Hupperdook. It's the funniest name.


You're not the first man to panic at the loss of his shackles. I hope you eventually enjoy the freedom that you've just been given from your legacy.


Oh. I don't. Okay. I will take this with me. I don't like groups of people working together for a cause. I will take it with me. I walk away.


We have jars. I'm going to put that into the jar and put it away.


We have chalices.


It kind of is. Yes-- Erwen. Bring them down here. It's an emergency


Ashley is getting home right now, in case we need her.


Is Shauna around at all?


Literally, not figuratively.


Yeah. He or she may not reveal themselves too quickly.


I don't think that meant we're going to leave the Fire Plane before we settle the favor that he constantly reminds that we owe him.


You cannot be frightened, and you gain resistance to fire damage, and when you are struck by a melee attack, the attacker suffers 2d6 points of fire damage!


I take it back.


This is a terrible plan.


Now we have two. As two slam into the ground beside you, dropping from the ceiling portion.


Their leader is massive. We were scared. This one wet his leg, and he's gigantic. We just didn't know what to do.


I try to get away, but--


I do. We actually have a keep now in Emon.


There's an ancient death thing down there.


Better ale.


Math has no power here.


No one is a hero for very long.


Is that where your mom works?


Okay. Good to know. I'm going to loop back around. Is there like an open window in the temple that I can just fly through--


Can I do a nature check to show them it's just fucking fog?


Focus on the dragon!


It's called crisscross applesauce now.


Can we watch?


I have a lot of rings. I should see if I can get any good money for some of them.


I see what happens.


Can we breathe?


Whitestone, Whitestone.


I saw that, it was great!


Hi! Nice to meet you all. What are your names?


Is there just one of us who can make a big stink in the decoy house?


I'm keeping an eye out for anyone watching.


Yeah, and we defeated her.


And the spiderwebs are covering the walls.


(sings) For free.


If it's possible we'll see what we can do.


What was that? What is this?


I let two of the globules hover around the front of each boat. One at the front and one at the back of each boat.


Okay, well it's good enough, I guess.


That's mean.


Perception roll to tell if it's an earthquake?


Just barely hits? Oh, that's better than I thought. That is three plus six is nine for damage, and then the Keen Dagger comes back, and that gets a 27, so that also hits for nine of damage.


Vax, Cassandra, let's take her to the acid pits.


Did I?


Arkhan's going to stay, just in case it needs, like, a double--


We should not tell the others about this. This is very strange.


I'm going to run outside, and see if I see anything.


Please don't ever do that to me again.


What is that thing called? Uncanny Dodge? Uncanny Dodge! I'll reduce that to three.


You have to use the tongue, Scanlan.


That'll be way worse.


You smell like shit.


I was being friendly, and it almost crushed me. Trinket, be careful, this thing was made for you.


Should've made it-- That's a--


No more shopping today.


That's a hangnail on his pinky toe.


You got some damage in, no? Yes? That stake was well done. Yeah! (laughter)


Fort Daxio has an army gathering there already, right?


I flip it off.


Saving throw, saving throw. Come on, Scanlan, you lucky motherfucker! Roll high.


I get in the water.


Trinket is with us.


Yeah, I just found you guys, just hanging out.


Didn't make it. Didn't make it to K'Varn, didn't make it to the shirts.


It's very far. We could Misty Step to the forest and then walk in the forest?


He is so stoned.


I'm gonna take two shots at the little oozes. At the--


Okay. Now I'm going to protect the three of us, at least the three of us for now. Unless I get Caleb too with the bear spirit totem.


We'll be putting out a catalog.


It has no effect?


It's holy arrows. All of them will be holy arrows, because Conjure Barrage uses whatever kind of ammunition I have shot.


I'll go to Orly and say  While we're underneath, if you see another ship enter, or danger present itself, make for land and we'll find you.


You guys! We killed a dragon.


Just burn it.


It's a spyglass, I assume. Yes, here. You can look through and you can see that everything is very far away.


Just an hour and 40 minutes to sign a contract.


Then I don't even have to use a resolve. 19.


We ran into those guards that were patrolling the lake--


You have inspiration dice.


Oh, you can do that!


Which one looks friendlier?


Slow is out the window. I pull out my clay cat's paw and mutter a few words, and I will cast Maximilian's Earthen Grasp. A soil cat's paw comes up out of the ground and swipes. It needs to make a strength save. 16.


(Metal Gear voice) Must have been my imagination. (all laugh)


The tieflings!


I've eaten, let's politic.


Percy's got it, yeah. I'll take second.


Good to know. I'll keep-- mum's the word. Huh.


Wow, this is a look.


Well, they tell you to go out and gather a group of friends, and then thrust yourself into a death-defying situation that is likely to get people killed.


Can I use the rest of my movement to go back down the stairs?


What'd he say?


And maybe then you all can decide what to do. Whether to part ways, as friends or enemies. But I can help you. I know people there, and I can get you safe passage, fine accommodations, the best food, even some realistic-looking antiques.


Following your partner.


(shouting) UselessRogue!


You've had a lot of good ideas. That's not one of them. That's a bad idea.


Scorching Rays on that guy!


While they were doing that, I pull Vax aside. I grab him--


They arguably have their shit together way more than the three of us do.


Okay. I'm going to be about that height, but I want to be over the edge.


Baseline magical?


He's looking at the Great Wall. He rarely references the Great Wall.


Flip for it. Heads or tails?


When you drink tea made of dead people, you see things.


I'm the leader. So what do we do until the guard comes back?


Well, we're not going to speak of that in mixed company, but they're dealing with other problems.


Oh, hits!


Play it safe.


I'm sorry I'm naked. Come here. I'm all right.


Let's hope it doesn't come to that.


A history check? That's so-- okay. A natural twenty.


What level spell was that?


Is there shit I can do with my bonus or is there nothing I can do with my bonus? Probably not. That might be everything I can do. Yeah, I'm going to cast a quick Healing Word on Yasha who could probably use a quick Healing Word.


Oh, that crits!


Is that as far back as I can get? Yeah. And I'll use my bonus to reload.


Hey, that die!


Yeah, we're all going in.


I hunter's marked, he's hunter's marked already.


Hey, Grog. All he gets to is strangle me to death. That's it.


I know there's a row of it back there.


I'll take both.


Jesus...


And that will end. And I will sit (sipping) the rest of the ale and wait for something. Keeping my mind on a small leather pouch in my bag.


Yeah, it sounds like we've all been through hell. Okay.


Oh, no there's not!


During the War of what? Beginnings?


Is it a bigger space in here?


Fjord rushes up, summons the blade, and points it at her, summoning a little eldritch energy in his off hand, and says: Drop it. That's my turn.


Advantage to charisma rolls.


Please say no.


I was taking a snapsnot.


And that is eight.


We have a 50/50 shot if we get two in him.


11 plus 17, 21, 26, 29, 34, 39 for the first dagger.


Burning Man!


(whispers) Rad. I know, so cool!


I'll take those.


Enjoying himself. God knows. He has things that belong to me.


Oh, I do. I do. They look very powerful.


That does not hit him. Come on. 19?


Oh, lord have-- oh, sweet Sarenrae.


I will!


Sounds like there's, I don't know, drainage or something coming from slightly up in that direction.


You made him, after all. You would know.


If you ever make a road sign, people are fucked. That is--


I come up to the door and see what I can see with my darkvision.


Does he get an attack of opportunity if I run?


D-Roll is actually pretty slick.


You, sir, is that 250 a night or 250 total for our stay?


Oh. Group effort. TRAVIS. Sure it was. Nott. Thanks.


Yeah, but it's a 300-foot range spell, and he's only 150 feet away. I don't think he can dash 150 feet.


No, against the wall.


No, it's charm or sleep.


Wait no, you're putting temporary hit points on! What are you doing?


I guess we go out and set up a little fire.


We should rent a ship.


How much? Eight and nine?


Yeah, let's go tell Mama what we did!


The broken pieces of whitestone, are there any that are the size of two hands?


Plus, we're good friends of Claudia's!


And they came to town to stay and to just see the town, and they told me something a little disturbing. Ogden said he's been having visions and dreams about something about a blood curse. Does this sound familiar to you at all?


Yes, I know how to do this! Attack plus eight, so that's 21.


It's more of a hug.


They're really good.


And how long does he last? He just lives until he's done?


Into the earring I say, this is our chance, we leave him as a distraction and we go. They don't know we're here, we can run!


Hey, guys, we have some boxes of very special dice here, and they included a letter, but it says, "Please do not read on stream," so this is for you guys to read when we go offline, but we're going to hand these out as well.


On all of us?


Well, we're in the boat. But Grog and I want to go. Right?


Can we go in as gas?


You have plans?


Is that stupid? (laughs anxiously)


It smells like roses inside.


That's brilliant.


What was that last name, again?


Or give it to me.


(mouthing) We should go, we should go that way.


Frumpkin, go spy on the ship. [laughter]


Hang on, wait. What's it doing?


Like a Wookiee.


I've been called an honest man.


I'm using my new fancy counter.


Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25.


Chop chop!


Yeah, they're booby-trapped.


All right, well.


Do they have something in royal blue?


Well, it is a he. This is my cat Frumpkin. Frumpkin, yes.


That was good, wasn't it?


I couldn't have run up and looked at her, to know it was poison? To see the black around her fucking--? Cool. 27 for the attack on Trinket, and then that is a 14, no, that's a lie. 11.


Crick assassins!


Yeah, we're fighting up.


Who's that guy?


I've never been thinking clearer than right now! I see this working big time.


Reality shifting things?


Ain't no stretch of time I ain't ever done that could break a man.


That's what you call a giving tree.


Wait, there's other objects that we haven't--


Cats sometimes.


(muffled) Oh my god!


They all failed their save. He thinks that we're the bad guys now.


Yeah, either that or it's like a pub crawl through Whitestone, one or the other.


Yay Trinket!


Yikes. Well. Are we outside the mansion?


And 27 for the third.


What are people doing?


Oh, you poor man.


I slap him across the face.


Or we could just go to Westruun. Is Westruun still there?


Right. Minus five, is 31 to hit.


Excuse me, no interest in the other rooms, or shall we leave?


I'm going to mount Grog.


I grow lilies, I grow bramble, mushrooms, moss.


That's a Sneak Attack.


It was Pike's grandfather, yeah. And plus, she's a healer.


Well, I don't want to be a bother, yes, but. Do they entail any part of those threshold crests? I'm wondering because perhaps we might find ourselves in need of traveling, as well.


Legerdemain?


Ask Irena about the little girl.


I put my gun to Lady Briarwood's head.


Sylas is up and moving.


Dear Traveler, please heal everyone. Do you guys feel better?


I thought it was just you two guys.


You're welcome. Wait until nightfall.


Don't let the bird get hit by Umbrasyl!


Lots of centerfolds. (laughter)


I think we've found one. There's a trap right there.


So, we get--


Bluude!


Got you.


All right. The two fucking people talking to--


Grab them; slit their throats.


Has tried to pretend to be a human woman in any other place? Should we ask around, or was it just the one ruse here to gain entry for her companions?


Grog, you're so strong!


Yeah, okay. Six.


It was good.


They were far off in the distance!


Take this! You are an impressive specimen, my good man. I have never had a fight that amazing in at least a week. That was something to see. Here, take this, and after this one there's three more.


We'll find something.


Not some metal Medusa that turned them into metal?


I just want to find out what was up from somebody.


No, that door's around where Doty is standing, is around the corner.


While they do that.


Is that a cantrip?


Do you wanna handcuff him?


Because I don’t get any storm damage.


I was already-- towards…


Do you know anything about this island? Is it large?


But he said intruder when we came in.


I get a whisper?!


Thanks, Scanlan!


Plus the Bless?


It's still 10 34.


I'm heading straight up there.


Who said that? I will beat him with my fists.


As the years pass, we should start a festival and bears will be everywhere.


They're even changing the name, they're making it more hip, it's going to be called WhiSto now. It's great. Just shortening it.


It's really just a knee-jerk, it would've happened if it was anybody. You could've been a scarecrow, and I would've been like, "Fuck off, bro!"


I know. I don't think I'm going to go into my beast shape form so I can do another spell next turn. Can I just tuck and see if I could take a bonus action to hide in this little nook and cranny here?


Yeah, add your points right now.


Life is disappointing, eh?


I love all Critters, and I feel the love.


(singing) Oh, look over there! It's a bear! Yeah!


There's nothing between us and the building?


Tarantino film.


He's like a Kids in the Hall character.


Wyrmwood Gaming, they make gorgeous, beautiful gaming boxes. They make lovely Christmas presents and if you use the code CritRole, you will not have to pay for shipping on your Wyrmwood Gaming order. They're gorgeous.


Brand new t-shirt for sale, guys.


I get off the broom and put it behind me.


Of course. I squeeze it way too hard.


Can we sneak around the hut?


That would be a very big toad.


Three.


Only one way to find out! Not today.


Aha! That will be a-- with the plus one, that's a 28, 29, 30 to hit.


What? You're not going to kill the smoke beast?


Yeah. Well. Does that take an hour, or do I catch up with him pretty quick?


Yeah. One last thing.


Hey, what do you think that dude meant when he said it wasn't like a normal fight?


Great. That is-- motherfucker, six.


Little steps.


I am exhausted. I can't do anything else right now.


Can I--


I will also use my second wind.


Changed your day, didn't it? Everything's coming up flowers now.


-- was given to me by Wil Wheaton.


Well, tell me what you are able to do.


Oh wait. Seeming has ended at this point, hasn't it?


You're being incredibly childish. Don't do that.


Yeah, that sometimes things don't work out the way you were hoping?


Yes. Well, I do believe I still have a Spiritual Weapon.


Kash money.


Um, Grog, I can come with you, Grog, if you need some help.


I toss him a silver.


I would like to announce a small amount of progress for Laura Bailey, who resisted the urge to keep a super cool d20 for herself, which she wanted to do. She gave it to me.


She's probably at the bottom.


It's all right, darling. We're going to a loch. It's going to be great fishing for you.


The greatest plan we have is what Grog came up with, which is pitting them against each other.


That's boring.


Yeah, what's the problem with that?


That is a 25 to hit.


Is that really his name?


Can I take it with me?


He's an ambassador to the city.


Yes, hi, hi. What's your name?


You fucking made out that you were hiding in crystal clear bathwater, motherfucker! If you say it, it's real!


I know, I know!


I think these belong to an M&M character?


One time.


I thought so.


Seven. I'm just excited!


No, not Toya. Over the head.


Good, good, okay.


Is it pitch-black in there, or is there a light source?


Do y'all hear that heartbeat in your ears?


Let us wait for talk of worth and talk of might until we are reunited.


Why don't I just make us both invisible?


I mean, does she still have a sword through her, can I pull her off of it and then cast it?


I want to fly down and get him around the waist and pull him out.


Mildly hurt.


No, it's good.


This is a day of glory. A great battle has been won.


How about everybody gets a thousand gold.


There's a bookcase, is there not?


We are background checking a fucking bakery employee in our Dungeons and Dragons game!


It was very good, yeah! You did good!


Champ? His name's Champ!


I would like it to just spew forth out of my gonads, just at them.


I was like, don't touch it.


So you're enchantment. That means I have transmutation.


Fjord, does this look like a little much? This feels like it doesn't go with my outfit.


Is there a cricket in the studio or is that part of the sound effect?


Oh no, it's starting.


She can do so much more than just arrows!


The bear is a necessity. (groaning)


I mean... I guess if you guys don't have anything else to do, yeah.


He has? Oh, and Vex is right next to him? Five feet? I'm going to stab him in the fucking face as I fly in the door. 24, hits.


Step back! Step back!


Okay. I would like to cast Compelled Duel on Vecna. It's a long shot, but I'm going to do it.


I'm Hannah. You should check it out. It's an awesome comic book.


That's embarrassing. Okay.


(laughs) That's my friend.


Yeah, roots. Sure.


I would imagine the Plank King would not know what to make of it. It clearly damns her. It does not give him enough information-- He wouldn't know what to do with it.


Yeah, please, I wanna go with Pike.


It's nice to be home.


Can I accompany Vax on this trip?


Nope, fuck that.


(door slamming)


My captain name?


Well, it could add credibility to the tapestry that we’re trying to weave here. The goal is still to get into Sutan elder’s home and get this seal.


Wait, you're taking us to the lost and found? Please! This is the high baroness Lady Vex'ahlia!


It snares all ranged.


We can definitely steal a boat.


And all these many months, you've been in possession of the horn you have?


What's under the freakin' lake?


Let's take a short rest.


Full.


Was that a dick joke? [laughter]


Thank you, god. No it doesn't, 24 minus five.


I like how we're walking through all of these ideas and none of it's going to work when we get there.


Also known as spatial defense in the barbarian world.


No rush. But make sure it happens.


197.


Yeah. I don't know. Where are we?


Supplies are limited.


You guys are sticking to the darkness?


He was a weird character choice.


But be secret when you put it in my bag, okay?


Seventh level, so it's ten ten-square-feet. So let's do like--


Oh, lord. Oh no.


Super slow, super careful.


Doesn't excuse me from human decency. (laughs)


Can't we just thread the needle and play them both?


Where would those be?


I am already out the door, with a flourish.


D&D Beyond just released-- this is actually kind of exciting-- just released the new Creatures section. Users now have a place to add any type of monster stat block for easy reference during play! You can add your favorite wild shape or familiar forms, keep up with your ranger's companion, summoned creatures, mounts, ferrets-- or what do we have, a weasel?


You killed him. On purpose?


26 for those two. Plus Hunter's Mark. Oh, wait! No, 30 for those two. And 9 for Hunter's Mark.


And then he has to make a strength saving throw.


Boy oh boy. You say you can take a hit?


You're splitting the party!


The next day?


Is that the first time?


Well, our options are somehow flying up or going in the front door.


So that's an eight.


Your other clothing?


That can be a lot of it. I'm not going to lie to you about that.


How far away am I from Vex?


From where?


You're a dick. I'm joking. I think it's fairies. I think we should probably stay clear. It looked like there were things living in the tree. It doesn't look like the cancerous tree.


Keep her unconscious.


Yeah. Right, good, maybe--


Is 16. Oh no! And the second one is a 27.


Great, that'll help.


That's fine. Ask Pike.


Yeah. I'll go, too.


Aw, I don't want to have Sphincter next to Caleb now!


Diving and grabbing the head and curling back around--


Is there any way to get in there?


Be a badass, be a badass.


Does that cancel out our fear?


You were in Alfield.


Well. To each his own, am I right?


I'll get shunned for it happening, then I'm like, oh, cool. I don't have to worry about me right now.


And five plus seven is--


Yeah, but then we put it in his court when he shows up. Favors.


Even after we find 25,000 gold pieces worth of diamonds, I've never brought anyone back before, and this is versus the Raven Queen. How do we know if his soul is even available for return?


Sorry, it really wasn't my intention to do that. I was aiming for his shoulder, and I missed and hit his head.


No, no! We came to save you, the money's the bonus.


I rolled a 20 for stealth!


On the side of the house.


Was that inside of me? Did you touch inside me? Oh, fuck.


I don't know, it's a piece of paper. It's pretty cool. It's called a Brooch of Living Essence and it basically masks the wearer's alignment, essence, whether they're good or evil, they can't be seen by Detect Magic spells.


Are you going to do your thing?


We thought we would do it on the livestream just to really help capture the traffic that that would bring.


I walk upstairs.


Okay. Good puppy.


Really? I'm with it.


I'm still down there, investigating.


It's fine, I've got a thought, so I'm gonna try something.


They're legit.


(muffled) Fucking hell.


I haven't seen any evidence of that.


(groans in relief)


Natural one, natural one.


You're going to hurt your foot again, Vax.


There were words in there.


We don't need all of them, though. Just to cause further distraction, or to get some allies on the inside.


You don't have any potions of healing or anything that could maybe heal someone if anyone needing healing would--


Son of a butcher, well. Everyone has their own personal path. Or he will come back to me, and if he comes back to me, I will train him. If not, it wasn't meant to be.


Yeah, throw it in the air.


Yeah, I noticed.


I understand that, but we are dancing along the razor's edge of death, so, you know, I feel like you should embrace the morbidity of life.


Thank you. To be perfectly honest, yes. There were quite a few people chasing me. But I'm super fast. Not really, I'm just really sneaky.


You guys are just in further then?


Keep him looking around.


One's a child, though. You won't even notice him.


Well, the first thing that we're going to need, is we're going to need a way of connecting this to him without limiting his movement, so I'm making so it's a very accessible, easy harness to get this on and off. And starting to design and put together how we're going to-- what I'd like to make is a couple-- a porcelain cover for the hands and face so that it actually looks like perhaps-- it won't draw immediate suspicion, but if it does, it will look like somebody with an artificial limb, maybe they've been hurt.


Because-- shut up, slave! And I smack Grog with the flail.


How many of us can change? One, two, three, four.


I like picking up the pieces.


I'm going to take the whole jewelry box and sort through it later.


I think this thing is carnivorous.


The Shadow Knight.


I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm really confused.


I'll climb after her.


What are we--


He has to make a strength saving throw.


Now, here's the thing  goblin girl and hobo wizard have this spell where they can talk into your ear. You probably won't be able to respond back as a mouse except for maybe squeaks. Squeaks?


I think I can.


Like Uta Hagen, but Utugash.


Who are we missing? Why? She was just here with a bear.


Let's go pick up Trinket.


All right. Is some of the business that we can expect going to go against the fair people of this city?


We'll see what happens!


That sounds complicated.


Well, if we're ever invited to a Masqueradé-- is that how you say it?


Some of them, yes.


And that's-- well, that's two regulars left.


That was so sudden!


All right, that will be fun.


Yes. I was about to say I'd like to move ahead of the group a bit and start sneaking along.


From the treasury.


Should we go after her? I can hunt her down.


What about the Feywild?


Okay. I make an attack roll for three arrows. Okay, that’s a good one. That is 31.


Well, I got a missive, I got a scroll in my room and the first assignment. I mean, it was very exciting to me and they haven't really paid attention to me. Mertin is very nice to me but Vanessa-- she just has her days, and I've been asking her for so long, and finally I got my assignment. I was hoping Aldor would be here, but he isn't, and that's fine. It'll be the next one. But there may not be a next one, guys. That's what I'm saying.


Keep going. (laughter)


(gasps) With the dude with the black horn.


What's that? Plus a d10 to my initiative now?


Bye! Be safe. (laughter)


I would join him so I can grab the mallet, the mace that the pit fiend had. Unless it turned to ash as well.


What about in the game?


Well, we don't know how wide. How wide?


Well, it doesn't work like that.


Does it look like it has four appendages?


Okay, that hits.


Sure feels like it, doesn't it?


Just a guard. One of the guards.


Well, we'll have to go in town and buy some replacements for you.


I don't want to go to where the blue is, I just want to see if I can peek down there?


We'll find out he used crayon. It's all written in marker.


Wait, we don't know who sent it?!


Yes, what would start an uprising?


Yeah, he's probably squeezing one out. It's okay.


Don't look at me. I'm just the translator.


They will freak out if 20 refugees pour out of the Sun Tree. And they have no context.


Why not? Reckless.


And I'm going to use-- shit. No, I'm not. Where's Trinket?


All the dice are doubled?


I'm heading straight towards the exit.


We fucked up. Oh man.


She says to a nearby tree.


Oh, sorry. Damn it!


Thank god. It's been so long! Where are all my dice? Just a nick. 16 points of damage.


Oh, so it doesn't increase it three darts per level. It's one. So if I do a level four, I get two darts for each fucker.


Yeah, she was bringing him home.


Fine.


Do you have anything you can do to make yourself not look like you?


We have books, there were books, we kept books.


Oh, on the goblin side?


So we never went up to the war camp and through it.


We have to be where I cast it, yes. Yeah.


I take a shot.


Why are things more complicated, Percy? Clearly, we all just witnessed what just happened.


We actually have a carpet we were thinking of using for this.


Once again, I have no idea if this is the creature that we're in pursuit of, but this talks about it not eating food, but siphoning the life off of mortal creatures, but not to the point of death or harming them. They might not even notice that it's happening.


Discretion is appreciated.


She's rolled twice.


So glad that your smoke monster is seemingly gone, Percy. That's wonderful news. The spinning orb of death, however, is still back there, so we should probably figure out what to do about that.


Do I even see them?


So it's got to be that.


Don't we all?


I was just striking conversation.


I'm at that other corner.


You guys have the best fans.


I dunno, it's right here. It's right here.


Oh, I can shoot lightning breath, right?


I hate it when that happens.


You never can tell.


East Lake.


Molly, they have a covered wagon!


This is why I left Trinket. Because he wouldn't have been able to come down here anyway. Just so you know.


G'day mate.


Everybody but Grog?


I should've said like the swamp, right? Your eyes are like stagnant water, green and-- no? Green and yellow in places.


Heal. No, wait, something.


It landed on a -


Are any of the spectrals looking at one, specifically?


(melodramatic groaning) Oh, the pain of-- what's this thing called? Confires! It hurts so much.


Just keep it going, I'm just going to-- and I just roll off.


My friend John bought me some smite dice. Let's go. Oh man, that's not a lot. That's rough, isn't it?


Yes! [cheering]


I'm the booker, so you pay me.


Hits also.


I walk towards the door.


(whispering) I don't think he's here.


Evil Grog is not a good idea.


Well, we'll find out. Let's make a break for it.


32.


And you know what--


I'm a dick. I'm always a dick.


Okay, that's a stupid question, sorry.


I also used another Disguise Self spell to make sure I stay--


Maybe we can fashion--


And some boar!


It's very true, we have a hard time seeing things that aren't moving, it's very true. But I can hear you. You should take a bath. You know they have showers here. It's possible.


I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace. Everybody's got plus ten to their stealth.


This-- what? I don't even see what you're talking about.


That's from your personal fucking funds!


I'm pretty sure it's up up down down left right left right A B A B.


The fact that they can't speak.


There's two?


Okay, I would--


You had to think about it. (laughter)


No, but can't you use your rock-changing ability and squish all the rocks down and close the cave off?


I rolled for him last week and he appropriately only has one hit point.


Why the dramatic pauses?


Clap on (claps), clap off. (claps)


That's enough for all of us if we gather.


Whack!


Maybe that's what we need to look like.


It takes time, and equipment.


Okay. I tried. Sorry, guys.


That would be have been donesies.


Plus nine. 27.


Are you open all the time?


When is the trap going off? When does the alarm go off?


We've probably, I imagine, been narrating an awful lot of what's going on through the headpiece. Well, maybe not.


That is a 33 to hit.


I'm going to just sit, it's been a long, long day.


All right, Grog. Since you and I have darkvision-- Is it still-- did you cast Light?


Let's go. Out we go.


I do, I have a--


Thanks for coming right next to me on that one. Goddamn it.


You have five? Total?


That was terrible!


How were you planning to guide us through it if you don't even know how to do it?


I didn't use two of my luck. I saved them!


In solidarity.


That's the way!


Oh, it's just two? Okay.


No, it's a beak.


Also, the little--


No, no! That is not true!


It's not concentration-- Oh it is concentration, isn't it? Where is it? Yeah, it is concentration. Fuck. God damn it.


You know what, don't answer now, don't answer now. I know that you want to say yes, but please, don't answer yet. Just think about it and we'll talk about it some other time.


Otherwise, hey, free copy for us, which is really cool.


Oh my gosh!


Can I do anything to help him?


Oh, we were just saying how well you look.


Can't argue. 40 gold.


Let's stop dicking around and go into that mine.


I check my bed to make sure no one shat in it. (laughter)


It's just a roll? Not great. Nine!


We're trying to find Febron Keyes.


He's so excited.


That means moose. I'm so excited. Senshi Con in Anchorage. I'll be there. I know we at least have, like, three fans at the very least in Alaska. Come on by. I'd love to see you. It'll be awesome.


It's where some of us are from.


Where's the book right now?


Oh god it's magnified. It's unbelievable! Human jerky!


Oh, that's no good. That's, nah, it's 12.


I'm going to ask about this. When next we see Pike, I'll ask her about it.


Yeah, I mean, what're we going to--


That's what I said, but they punish crime so harshly.


Scanlan, maybe not black birds for a while. All right? It's a touchy subject.


Like rapids?


Uh-oh.


No traps?


So 30. Cool. Awesome.


I have evasion. That's the only reason I'm okay.


Let's take it into dock. Against all the advice of zhelezo looking for a burned ship that had a Fireball.


If I turn into a snake, can I get down there? Big snake? (laughter)


I get a new blood curse. I want to have a conversation about that before we go into that.


They said it four or five times.


My palms are really wet.


Do I recognize the music?


It is a scam. (laughter)


Aw, yeah! Come on out! (all applaud)


Amazing! Incredible! Stupendous! No, I have nothing to add, other than-- do you need my assistance in cleaning up any of these ruffians? Oh, also, one question.


While they're having a conversation, I want to do a scan and see if I can see any floorboards that look like they can be popped up, maybe marks on the floor from chests, anything that looks like it could be a secret compartment.


She also has a big old crushie on Fjord.


Percy? I'm sorry, but I think our methods of being rulers might differ. I don't think I need to sell myself for the greater good.


We may have eaten some souls.


It would be amazing if you pulled this off.


I’m taking both of you -


I'm going.


Oh my god. It's Graceland!


This is it? So now we ask for her by name? Or him by name? Korshad?


Does Doty get hit?


What are we going to do with this little kid and/or old lady?


Okay. I will.


We used to play-- don't over-listen to it!


I'm just walking up behind Nott, no further, and looking in to see what glows.


Slayer's Take.


Right. Are they around this part?


I do not let her. I am in a corner.


Ok, I'll roll the twins. Hey, really good. That's a 22.


Or it's just a sword.


Cloaked Vax?


I'm running with them towards the doors


It all depends on the definition of desecrate. I could fly you 500 feet in the air, and you could shit upon that circle. It just depends if that is desecration in the eyes of the fey.


He's out of two miles' range?


The sweet Caroline?


Does the little Fjord look wet or dry?


That's sort of cocked. I'll take it anyway. 11 plus nothing.


Ionos, I think is what it is.


Should we meet back at the Song & Supper Inn at what, sunset?


Is it? I can't feel anything.


Tiberius, can you send a little light down that passageway?


No. Maybe he was already a vampire and he hung him from the tree just to show--


I'm bored as shit.


Well, he's not in the room. He's in the front yard, at this point. So we are heading to the room.


That'll break it. (laughs).


How much further down is it?


With the plus ten?


Yeah, he was a fucking dragon.


It doesn't count on the floor.


I encourage massages.


Seven plus six. 13.


Can you feel us near you?


Did you add ten?


This is gonna be cool, this is gonna be cool. It's gonna put them all in one spot.


I was going to say, actually, I think as Control Water, I can also change if it freezes and if it's solid? Can I freeze the edges of this? Make an awesome--


Would you go fry the fucking lake?


Off of her first comment I would send one of the globules floating up to the ceiling to better illuminate what she's pointed out.


Oh, okay. No, I'm going to try to hit it. It's my big gun, I don't want to be like, sorry. I'm like, I just did this and it looked amazing.


Oh, man. Eight.


I would assume.


Oh boy. I wasn't expecting to attack this turn. I'll do the lightning again because it seemed to have some damage. No, you know what? We've got to block his sword, right? Shit. I will Bigby's Hand and try to grapple his sword.


I don't really feel like fighting. I just want to go talk to Master Splinter at the Trial Forge.


Ooh, Enhance Ability.


That's very sweet.


I take off running to the left.


He does have a point.


That's true, where was Ripley last seen? That's probably what I would try to do. I would push it that way.


I'll do the math.


Yeah, I drunkenly form the Goblight!


Ambush.


I love skyships.


Any other boxes to smash?


Do you know Pumat Sol, by any chance?


Yeah. I left and I'm sure they were coming after me and I got into the wastes of Xhorhas, and something happened. There's time that I cannot account for. I was out there for months by myself, and it seems like I woke up months later and I looked different and I felt different. I woke up at an altar of the Stormlord, and he saved me. For what, yet, I don't know, but hopefully I can be a better champion for him and fulfill whatever purpose he has for me.


Yeah, let's do it! Just because I can!


Transport Via Plants. I always say that wrong. Tree Stride's a 5th-level spell.


Wait, it's not your turn. I just gave you dice. I thought you said Vax. Okay, sorry.


Plus your strength! Oh, it doesn't matter.


Well, it's a cantrip, or I could do a level three Gust of Wind.


Water slide?


To get that 100 gold back?


And really loud.


I'm afraid I can't, it's very--


And we can just pop on in there because of you, Keyleth.


Okay, in that case, natural 20. Oh, it has disadvantage, though, so it's still the 28.


All right. No, I just figured it'd be, I don't want to-- (laughter)


Oh that's right, you didn't meet Nila.


Okay. You guys just hunker down in the wagon, okay? You be safe.


No. That's us, right? One amigo, two amigo. You and I are amigos.


I want to train Nugget to blink back to us.


Mind the gap.


But there are lots of them, and they're fast and invisible.


(high-pitched) Okay. Well, all right!


Why be fast? What are we in a rush for?


She's hiding that she's actually not okay.


It was 14.


Are they open?


Ride the bear.


Should we keep moving forward at a very stealthy sort of pace?


And it's not translucent? It's like an opal-like stone?


What do your eagle eyes see, Grog?


Another day. You know, a little bit of me is worried that this scroll case will explode, so I think we should check that out first.


Thank you very much, Clarota.


They?


No no no, where they're coming from.


Dragon's like, hello!


And just one more regular attack.


Maybe they can take Kiri.


Here's to fighting for something more than just money.


Yes. So we should probably go talk to them as well.


I'll hop over that.


Yeah, I mean, she gave us a lot to "sphinx" about. (groaning)


Maybe I should have shown that to Pike sometime in the last year?


Are they fist-fighting in the background?


We got hit by meteor again.


I think we should stay here.


Longswords aren't simple weapons, so I can't?


Inconvenience of it all.


I didn't look at my phone.


What if what you're seeing, Ogden, and I mean no disrespect in any way, is a possible outcome or future that might not ever happen?


There's coffee next to you.


That was so close to being good. Five!


We need to carve out a plan, Kash is right, we should pick something short-term and do something because--


Stick something down my throat.


I stay by the tree.


You were never Mother's favorite.


I know, I do bring it up, though, that it is one those things that we should talk about.


This is what's happening.


Should we put some cards on the table?


I'm going to use Guided Strike.


It's quite lovely.


I think that means it's probably not down there, but I'd still like to take a look.


So, Trinket is a bear.


Thank you. It's the simple things.


Unless I have to roll with advantage.


Beans, apparently.


Second as well.


He ain't stepping out in high fashion.


Vulnerabilities.


Yep. There were things.


That's more than they said when we came out.


So that's with my first attack situation.


Do you know what will happen, if we take this sphere to the place of its choosing? Have you seen what's unleashed or have you only heard?


You're better at talking than the rest of us are?


I'm walking away.


He doesn't have a social security number!


Yeah, I schloof Frumpkin to the back of Caduceus' head.


Fucking gnomes! What happened?


I ignore three-quarters cover!


So, with the help, I had time to start working on a few projects. I finally made a new pair of glasses. Well, I tried.


Nila, I need you!


I'm going to send a few Messages out. Caleb, what room are you in? Caleb, what room are you in? Caleb, what room?


I cast Hold Person.


Yeah, that's what we're doing. So, kill the thing, get arrested, possible bug Keyleth, possible ethereal Keyleth as ways to get in and out. Possibly.


All right. Hang on. Let's think about this for a minute.


I'm good. I'm good.


(laughs) On Skype.


So now they're just straight-up bad.


A fortnight?


Why is reaching the Gilded Run a bad thing?


In his defense, every carnival I've gone to has said no sick people, no old people.
