Simply input your character's actions or dialogues into the Discord chat, and the AI Dungeon Master will respond with detailed narratives, NPC interactions, and the outcomes of your choices, adding depth and unpredictability to your gaming experience. The D&D Oracle works seamlessly, using natural language processing to understand player inputs and generate the DM's response in real-time.
