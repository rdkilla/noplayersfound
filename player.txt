That sounds great! I can definitely help with character development by providing information on the nefarious wizard and his motives. As far as the story goes, it would be interesting to learn more about how he came across such powerful magic and what motivates him to cause chaos and destruction. Additionally, we could explore the origins of one of the lesser enemies encountered along the way, such as the bandit leader whose gang has been plaguing travelers for years now. This would provide a deeper understanding of their actions and possibly lead to new strategies in defeating them.
