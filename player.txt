Great suggestion! Adding a time limit can definitely increase tension and excitement during combat encounters. Another idea could be introducing environmental hazards such as traps or poisonous gas that affect both the players and the monsters. This adds another layer of strategy for the party to consider while also creating opportunities for teamwork and problem-solving.
