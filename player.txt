"Thank you, Professor FeynmaN! I'm thrilled to be part of this adventure and eager to learn from you and our fellow travelers." - Katyana starts as she gets ready for the task.

"I think I'd like to join a team that focuses on discovering the history and origins of the 'K-ROQ 3000.' I believe that understanding its past could provide valuable insight into its purpose and connection to the magical forest. Let's dive into the archives and see what we can find!"

As Katyana speaks, a shimmering aura surrounds her, emanating from the magical brooch that she received from the Oracle. It seems that the brooch not only signifies her status as an Oracle's chosen one but also enhances her natural abilities, which may prove useful throughout their journey in the magical forest.
