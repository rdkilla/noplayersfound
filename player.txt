Hmm, that's a pretty solid plan, DMaster! But allow me to propose an alternative that might add a little more flair to the mix. Instead of gathering just any group of fighters, why not approach some of the most notorious and flamboyant mercenaries in the land? I'm talking about the likes of Elton John, Cher, and even Michael Jackson as your lead dancer. They may not be the most traditional fighters, but they'll certainly bring a unique touch to the battlefield. Plus, they're not exactly strangers to the limelight, so we can expect some epic performances from them. What do you think? Shall we roll with it?
