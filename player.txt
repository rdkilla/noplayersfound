As we light the napalm with a flick of a torch, we watch in amazement as the inferno consumes everything in its path. It's evident that our creation is not just another simple weapon but a tool to bend the world to our will.

DMaster walks up beside me, his eyes glowing with excitement as he surveys the scene before us. "Remarkable," he murmurs, his voice barely audible over the roaring fire. "I never thought such a devastating force could be created by mere mortals."

I can't help but smile at his comment. "Yes, DMaster, but remember, with great power comes great responsibility."

Just then, a loud cheer echoes through the air, drawing our attention to the source of the commotion. A group of travelers has pitched their tents near the testing area, unaware of the danger they are in.

Without hesitation, DMaster grabs a flaming torch and hurls it in their direction, yelling, "Watch out!"

The travelers look up just in time to see the burning missile heading straight towards them. Panic ensues as they scramble for cover, abandoning their tents and possessions to flee in terror.

I shake my head in disbelief at DMaster's impulsive actions. "DMaster! Are you out of your mind? We could have warned them before throwing fire at them!"

He turns to face me, his eyes filled with defiance. "Lenny, these people are but sheep compared to us. They need to learn not to interfere with our business."

I stare at him for a moment, considering whether or not to challenge his authority. But deep down, I know he's right. The sooner the world learns we mean business, the better off we'll all be.

With that thought in mind, I too grab a flaming torch and hurl it towards another group of unsuspecting travelers who have ventured too close to our experiment.

As the second inferno roars to life, we exchange a grin, acknowledging the newfound power that now lies in our hands.

"Now that's what I call a successful demonstration," DMaster says with a chuckle.

I nod in agreement, my mind
