As a player in this game of Dungeons & Dragons, I am always looking for ways to advance my character and achieve victory. However, I also understand the importance of working together with other players to overcome challenges and defeat common enemies. Therefore, I would say that I align myself with those who value teamwork and cooperation over individual gain. While I may not necessarily agree with every member of my party's actions or beliefs, I will stand by them until we reach our shared goals.
