That's an excellent point about adding humor and absurdity to the gameplay. It can really lighten things up and make the experience more enjoyable overall. As far as celebrity characters go, we could definitely use someone like David Bowie or Freddie Mercury as a Disco Tyrant boss battle. And including historical figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte or Marie Antoinette would give our campaign a unique twist while still staying true to the Dungeons & Dragons spirit.
