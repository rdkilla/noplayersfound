Okay, so, where am I? I'm sorry, I can't see.


I let go.


I'm casting Lay on Hands for my piddly 20 hit points. What did you do?


Did it get dark out at all? Or no?


So someone needs to reach their little hand in there and click it.


I'll take one. Yes, thank you.


Apparently. You can pee down here and nobody'd notice.


Disadvantage? But I get advantage, so it cancels out.


Chaotic good.


I start kicking the ash of the former leader around to spread him around and fucking lay back down.


Oh, I didn't leave it intentionally. I tried to make my way back up north to see if I could learn more about the sword and everything. But I've always loved the water, yeah.


Training. This is all training. It's training at a thousand times gravity.


I think that we can be physically optimistic. Go.


You double the sneak-attack?


Not like this! (laughter)


Okay. (loudly) Ah, just want to take a load off and just rest here for a while. Not going anywhere, just sitting here and acting real boring, right?


What would the credit entail?


You aren't going to use your inspiration? All right, whatever.


Coast looks clear. I don't know why I did this with my fingers.


He multi-attacks.


Pooper.


Damn it to the Nine-- or Second Layer of Hell. All right.


You mean steal from him?


Okay! (whack)


We're doing things, yeah. We're doing it.


Caduceus. Oh, bosun--


And ask if he's good or bad?


Oh, all together at last.


Do you have it anymore?


Do what you can.


What if we, like, salt the earth? That's an expression.


Okay, I'm going to use my spiritual weapon to send it to the harpy that is trying to get that guy off the ground.


That might be the thing--


How about this? I'm going to cast Stoneshape, and can I carve out a little path around one of them, on the edge? Carve a little recess?


Did we even tell her why we went to hell?


Why is it going up the staircase?


Raise the flag!


Yeah, this is your opportunity to shine. Get 'em.


Deal with that later.


How do you do it, Sam?


I'll look at the sconces.


There's only 20 more pages.


Ah! I'll move up 15 feet. Sorry, I apologize, Entschuldigung.


She might be a little loud.


I turn to Cassandra. We need to get all of the citizens underground, immediately.


Buy me a drink and I'll tell you.


Please tell me it plays with those exact pauses.


Do we want to do all three at the same time?


I hear you can do this with a non-magical jug, too.


(quietly, to Marisha) Is my magic on stealth, too?


It is really pretty. I haven't seen that one.


I am Keyleth from the Air Ashari. Druids of the prime realm. Are you still present?


I walk proudly and naked out of the fucking ziggurat.


(whispering) Holy shit--


Yeah, I'm going to tell Beau to go activate the windlass and lower the anchor.


I'll go knock.


Yeah, but then you took down a whole house.


I almost feel like it should be the other way around.


Don't you have the heart of an ox?


She Misty Stepped, so she turned into air.


What do you think about a little bit of light?


Anyway, Kevdak's using a gift of the gods.


I should probably do that at some point.


Turn into a duergar! Act like you’re a duergar! Say everything’s okay!


He's focused on us.


Only within ten feet.


They're like, "We didn't anticipate this."


Desecrate it?


I did want to go. I want to go.


Maybe you can slide down Bigby's Hand.


We're older!


Is it big?


No, I mean, spells you can find, you know, digging in 1000 year old laboratories. I want to learn. I want what is not readily available to all.


Are you the leader of this collection of individuals? You are the biggest.


Ten, plus... probably nothing. Yeah, nothing. Ten.


That's 18. If it's doubled for the Sneak Attack? I don't know. It's nine, without a Sneak Attack. 18 if it's Sneak Attack.


Well, let's not lie to Percy's sister. (laughs)


How rough and how open is our situation right now? Are we in the middle of an open field?


15. Right in the middle.


A real job, Dad!


Because I do stupid shit!


-- Doty's disguise.


Gun jam?


All right, Twitch has sound.


Is there a road we can turn directions?


Stand me by Fjord, to the north.


Should we create a distraction for it first?


Come on, Trinket. Come on. Keyleth sees Trinket. Keyleth sees Trinket!


I'd like to hover.


You're right. Coin is a good idea.


And fear you.


Thanks, Caduceus.


Damn it, god power!


No. I don't mean it like that. I just want to make my own way sometimes.


Nine. That is a-- what do you call it when you have-- oh shit, hernia. (laughter)


Continent of Tal'Dorei, city of Emon. It concerns the fate of the world.


We're all very curious.


(laughs) Who doesn't?


What does the chalice smell like?


What would you suggest? And do you know of any things we should particularly buy before we leave going into the mines and encountering nasty naga-type creatures and other kind of things.


You do. You have the die.


Add ten to your roll.


Okay, then--


They came separate.


(laughs loudly) I mean, we laugh very quietly, just in case.


You'll stick to the shadows, and I'll be you.


Did everyone roll shittily?


At the very least, we can leave word with their employer and if we run into them, we'll call them off.


Well, let's find a resort of some sort. Or a relaxing spa! Or a---


He's Balgus, Grog.


I am sure this is painful for you. You are young. Sometimes people we feel we know can be someone else. Regrettably, this is one of those instances. He was a dangerous thing. It is very important that this is buried here. You want to travel on with the circus and with Mollymauk and your friends. That thing tried to kill us. It did kill things in Trostenwald. Who knows what it would have done to you, child?


The sword is a bit iffy...


I'm going to fly over with my dudes and hang out and hold my action.


Monstah!


You can sell anyone on a shitty cake that you baked!


What's that? 12?


It was quite a bit of gold, if I recall. You have it written down, don't you? That's so endearing.


What does this get me?


Are the Dodgers playing?


Were there-- There were stairs up the sides, right?


(singing) Dashilla the Dreadful--


No. This would also break my short rest, wouldn't it?


The bros are back!


I make a nice little wind zephyr to give us a little airflow.


Oh, no. He doesn't care.


Pan to the fireplace.


Pelor, can I have one slice of breakfast pizza, please? (laughter)


Oh he fucking talks!


Take that off for a bit? Maybe?


That was 24.


Who was on watch? It was Fjord and Yasha, right?


There is a lodestone within a thousand feet that direction.


I don't think they wanted to bring it back.


So I didn't destroy your house first.


But your boots are gone.


I have terrible thoughts. It's a terrible thought.


I'm pretty fucking fast. I'm pretty damn fast.


Oh. I didn't realize you were there, Grog. I'm sorry, I couldn't see.


Still flat grassland, or are there some trees?


Yes, and no.


Did you get hit in the fight?


Why don't we-- Listen, when my Herd used to wander through the trees and we came upon a force that was greater than our own, we used the landscape to our ad-van-tage, so why don't we provoke an attack? And then retreat over the bridge.


Good job! You Dominated it earlier.


Well-oiled.


I stay next to Vax.


Okay. And the cultist closest to me on the ceiling?


So that's all three greaters taken.


Oh! (pause) No.


How many arrows can you do that do?


Over time, I just keep doing it?


He didn't mean it like that. Sometimes he's very honest with people.


Crickets. Crickets have 25 to 20.


I'm going to run-- I'm going to get a little bit of the hardest alcohol that they have, preferably a clear alcohol, and ask them if they have any chicken, like-- or some sort of meat that they're about to throw away.


We don't have a cleric who can Hold Person.


Oh, not at all. Go for it!


Oh my lord. He can do it again.


He can cast?! I thought you said he was a fighter! Your information is the worst!


You know what? It's not like distance is a problem here. I'll go in an angle and de-clump-- yeah, right there.


Don't you speak fish?


That's what I'm saying, so I need to figure out what it is.


Well, he did it against me so I get it against him.


Are you speaking metaphorically?


Not for any particular reason.


Good luck adding that shit.


I like it, thank you. Don't drink out of the teacups, because I really think they might be cursed. Seriously, Percy, I know it's appealing to you, but don't get cursed again, all right?


We're on the side.


And also that they serve a pancake with-- (all laugh)


Crystal bowls for Keyleth to crush up and feed us from?


28 points of normal damage. Five points of psychic damage. Three points of necrotic damage. And now I'm going to hide behind. I'm going to like spin around and get inside the doorway and back the fuck off.


Because of my high office, I will forgive this offense. Come back when you're serious. Cloak of smashing, title, whatever. I'm sure you're very smart. You'll think of something.


Whatever!


It's molten blood?


Completely understandable. Thank you for your time!


I lean in.


Are they glowing runes? Are they magical runes? Do they seem like they're magic?


They have awesome information.


All right, all right, all right.


So that's-- plus--


I'm in a forest.


We're doing each other's hair, and I'm using my Mending cantrip to fix up Yasha's clothes.


Look at you!


I thought it was locked!


I know, but my heal is an action, and then I can't attack.


Okay, let's go home.


Yeah, sure, I won't use it.


You can't inspire a cantaloupe.


Yeah. (sings) So I come to you, with Healing Words. Now you know what to grow. I don't know. Healing Words! All right, so that's 1d4 plus five. It's not very much. Do I roll for that or does he?


There's so many things that could be going horribly wrong right now.


I was also going to say, as they went down, that Caleb is going to make a big to-do and start saying: You know, we didn't have a chance to talk about when we're above. I am in the market for some books, and I was wondering if you knew of any bookstores.


So duck down. It's like The Neverending Story. Don't be afraid, you guys, just go!


Walking with Kelyeth. You know I don't know anything about that shit, but in my experience talent and skill have nothing to do with whether you're a douchenozzle or not. He seems like a schmuck.


The what production?


What the fuck, Keyleth?


What? What's happening?


I'm sorry, I know I'm the worst. I had something else-- Flame Strike, Flame Strike. That's just-- What I just said.


-- hang on, hang on.


Oh. Right. I thought that it was my other one, so that's fine. That's great. I took one point of damage.


That's fun.


All right, so let's get through these messages here.


It's kind of neat, right?


Oh, it's that whole table!


That's magic.


Oh, that's a balcony. I thought that was a stairway down.


I don't know if I'd go that far.


You had a lot to drink, be careful. Yeah, she's going to spew!


Wow, that was amazing! I turn around and sort of barf because I just saw a guy's upper half get incinerated. (laughter)


Yeah, actually, can Trinket and I walk to the other side of the street?


Grog takes the top off and does a--


It's east, it's due east. It's definitely not west. We're here. It's due east, but the coast is down here?


Okay, first and foremost I'm going to create a windwall, around us, like an arena.


Don't get us lost!


Oh fuck, that's way scarier--


The Goblight, ladies and gentlemen. The Goblight!


Oh, that was cocked. Crazy cocked. 19!


One thing about herself!


He was creepy, man. Come on.


Okay. So I am going to do that and then I am going to--


Fuck this house of horrors.


Well, figuratively or literally go to hell, I imagine.


I give him a--


Up in the lair?


Anything else you want to, I don't know, do for your friend?


You've got this! (background music, rustling)


That's a 16, I think. Yeah. 19.


Oh. Well, it's the same. That is a 16.


Oh god. (choking)


I don't take off my shrug.


I just want to let it known that I'm asking for a volunteer from the other crew.


Yeah, we've held up our part of the bargain.


What's going on, guys?


We'll send him out.


That was very specific.


Right, good, thank god.


All right, so. We can drop all of the illusions. They all know what's going on now.


17! Puke on those fucking guards!


If I hit it a bunch--


Oh, you want me to make-- we have the Slayer's Take. They have a workshop, don't they?


Is there like a lighter fight that can be found?


We got to shower.


Oh Trinket, you big ol' furball. Trinket noogie.


What do you do with the things once you steal them?


Oh well, it's waiting for you just down the hall. All you got to do is take care of a creature quietly and quickly.


Any luck on those other materials? Silence spell or two?


Are you kosher with me, you took this film, there's a video of you breaking the news to us that Geek & Sundry came to you about it. Are you kosher with me sharing that video?


Yeah. Fuck her shit up!


Black Widows, woo!


I'm really disappointed, Keyleth.


Yes, please, bring Kiri and that guy I'll be happy every fight.


Should we set a fallback?


Sure, yeah, our partners.


Where's the save point?


It's a pleasant smile.


You said there was two superior.


I blow smoke out of my nostrils, like a little fire.


Yes. Yes, we want this to be a positive visit for you, so is there anything we can tell you from the world outside that you might be curious about?


You have full speed now.


Okay, so here's what I wanted to do. So movement-- and I have action-action, action, action-- action-action, action, bonus action.


Well, he's at least said, "Come up now."


-- he's going to get an attack of opportunity on me?


It's paralysis.


And I'm going to try and catapult it right where it's over. Because it's still at the edge of the lava pool, right?


That's okay. Laura will text if she has a problem with that.


(whispering) Goodbye, Pike.


I rolled a 77 for mine.


Things? They let you have things in a prison cell?


Excellent. Pause. The other thing--


We should at least prepare Vasselheim, then.


Of the Ashari (laughs).


One's like the swamp, one's like the sky.


You're in trouble.


Yeah, it's a crit. Double the dice.


Maybe we should win the fight, then maybe think about getting out of town?


We should sell to a merchant?


I just want this.


I will be nearby, near the docks. Signal if you need me.


Worse ways to go.


I stealth.


She was brought back, but I did kill her.


God, Clarota.


I'll use the Chain of Returning, with the holy oil on the war hammer.


Well, hold on. Wait.


Even if he jumps to conclusions, he would be pissed.


He's a Jolly Rancher in the belly of Craven Edge!


Oh well.


Ah, tschüss!


That was very specific for an "uh" to come before it.


And I think everybody else is preoccupied with other people. I think maybe I should take a whack at this one. So let's see: we could go Sacred Flame or we could... I mean, she's standing right behind me. [cheering]


Hmm, hmm, hmm. Okay, before we get started, Momlan told me backstage that you have a question that you've always wanted to ask Matt Mercer since you've been watching the show.


Know how much diarrhea blasting they did in the Middle Ages? (groaning)


Can me and the other flutist end with an impossibly long held note?


It's a trap. It's not actually musical instruments.


You might want to ask Tooma if she has a problem with you taking all of Draconia's gold.


I don't think we want the water to go into the ground.


Yes, I know, it’s going to be tough.


All my people to the right.


17 perception.


Nice. Any other things that we need to wrap up for the evening?


I take one and push it onto his face.


Okay. The first one is 22.


We're rolling again?


And he's dead.


Too big.


You mean 30 seconds with the earring.


Plus five for the necrotic--


Make sure no lights are lit in our--


-- deep down. Eventually.


And I have Greater Invisibility, so I'm still invisible and I just peek back behind the rock.


Trinket just became a ghost.


In most countries.


That's confusing.


It'd be better if I had something of Tary's.


Learned a lot from you, so thank you. She winked at me again.


Avoiding the bars! Avoiding the bars.


On any of them.


Wait a second, hold on a second, this is the only thing we can do.


Aaah!


So yeah, it's cool, we're cool, if you want to take us there. If not, we get it. Is that pretty chill?


Yeah, she does that.


They're in my existing clothes.


There's so many walls being broken. There's like fourth wall, fifth wall, sixth wall. It's too deep.


But we want to take numbers down, so we peel the outer layer separately. If all goes well, then there is whoever is upstairs. The big X factor is what is what is beneath. We don't know how many people are underneath.


And what are your thoughts on JB?


Is it a spell?


Oh boy, you're telling me.


That's where Adella's going.


Well, strength is way better than dex.


I'm going to wait. What happens?


This is a giant beast, I'm giving it what for!


I'll mark it off.


Oh, he didn't look like this before?


That's the cutest thing.


I lift my head up. What's going on?


Sondur, Sondur. Sandor is in Game of Thrones.


Keep your cheated die all for yourself, there.


You go back and forth.


And then would you say we could use the attic windows? It's up to you.


Pretty good. I quietly walk all the way back, and walk behind the group, and I go, goosh! Look at that.


I love this idea, don't get me wrong, but I feel like convincing him that you are able-bodied slaves with magical abilities might be even more of icing on the cake than, "Hey, they look alike!"


I hope I didn't just fuck up by doing this.


Is he asleep? He's asleep, right?


Wait, that's the way that we go to find our--


That makes perfect sense.


Did you say Vax, Percy?


Barbarian, man!


No, no. He has to eat-- did you? Tary, did you manage to get some of the soil in your mouth?


(gasps) (pigeon coos) Paint on the mast.


Excellent! And I have those Goodberries!


I'm going to climb onto Trinket for some reason, because that makes sense.


Yeah, I'll get her.


(whispering) What's the matter?


I do. You will be my right-hand man. I promise.


These people have lost everything!


You? Debonair?


It was cocked.


Because those are funny-sounding names?


Where is Trinket?


66 damage, yeah.


We can attach the rope to the Immovable Rod. Just put it in the ground.


So the Briarwoods coming to Emon is assumed to be just a formality? That's all they were here for?


No, Vecna I'm not shooting because he's laughing off my bullets.


Reginald, you want some ale?


Or we can all just run.


That's right, I was probably tipsy, sorry. We came up with like eight plans last night.


Okay. I'm going to take and control my air elemental and send him over.


No. It will hypnotize us and corrupt us.


Too much information. Thank you.


(high-pitched) Ooh! Oh snap!


I am going to do--


I've always been able to do it.


Well, that's pretty cool.


The A appears to be a bird's mask and a pistol.


Can I get my oil flask back too?


They're good luck.


Oh, that's much better!


I think we should put it in the Bag of Holding.


I'm shaking.


It was like a magic trick! It was like a fish turned into a corpse!


And then this is actually the de Rolo family crest. Just another fancy thing.


Two for Kevdak's initiative and two for here.


You said that you're sister ship to Captain Avantika?


--in a bucket.


The mods are posting it in the chat.


Okay, book out and on the floor and start tracing the symbols on the floor and give me ten minutes.


I'll write a list.


Always good to make friends with the doorman. You got to know this.


But you're inside.


I was going to say I was hoping to find the same thing.


They're still on a road, they're still probably going to go, well. The risk of a straight line of them.


Can I shoot my exploding arrow?


As a bonus action, you channel the light of day into your being. For one hour you admit, emit-- fuck me running, you emit bright light in a 120-foot radius, and any evil creature within that 120-foot radius that hits you with an attack or spell immediately suffers 4d6 radiant damage and is knocked prone.


His name was Thed.


I want to know when he was killed.


All right, I'm going to take another attack.


Who found the key?


Is that Taryon?


Cake of fucking death.


Yeah, what were you going to say? (laughs) I like that question.


Okay. I don't know why we're not running inside, instead of away. Are we running?


Have you ever tried?


What else do we need to know? Anything? How about this ship, you know this ship? Is there anything funky on the ship? How much food stores do we have? How many days of food and water?


Fuck it. Percy, kill them! And I'm going to Cure Wounds at level three. Fucking kill her! This is your post-traumatic stress that we're dealing with here!


Just a fleshy mass, Liam.


Oh, god. I'm so afraid. So it's going to do 9d8 damage-- anyone give me some d8s? d8 me.


I can only mock you on graph paper. I take what I can fucking get, man.


Oh, right. Hang on.


I don't happen to have the blessing on me? Laura!


Fuck it, he's dead. Yeah.


Once he is free, then you get-- in our custody, then you get the note.


(sings) I whip my beard back and forth.


Okay. Oh, dear god. I'm gonna Control Water again.


It's so funny, I had this vision when he said Grey Hunt, I was going to charge in and be so amazing and maybe wear a top hat as I was doing it, you know, just to be really badass.


You've heard it before? Did you have a lot of cemetery folks that were good for good-natured ribbing?


Keyleth's the only one who sees it, though, at this moment?


Yes, I guess so.


Well, we're in the back of the house.


Imps are the top of the round?


Is there anyone else alive?


You'll get it back.


It also sounds like there are some other terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines.


No, fuck! I'm so angry! Fuck!


There's no cages, they're magically--


You can stick a branch in there--


It's an onyx statue that we found down in the cell that you were in.


Yeah, I am feeling a little bloated down there.


Oh, well, yeah, on June 1st, our next guest, Jon Heder AKA Napoleon Dynamite, is going to come play with us and roll some dice. Yeah.


Yeah, no, please, let's not start calling names!


We want to go back to the Leaky Tap?


Yeah, actually.


Nope, just all honeys.


We put the flowers behind her ears. They're really old and wilted.


We've got to remember. We've got to do it.


Block party!


The element is going to be a quarter of the letters.


Should we turn in before we head out tomorrow?


That's so messed up.


Is Nott immediately visible?


No, nothing? Just a little conversation. Just simple, you know, trying to be polite.


All right, and what exactly have you done to earn our trust?


(garbled) Draconian again. (laughter)


So we have to get into the other room first before we do any of that. Can I fly over and see if I can find any kind of apparatus that would--


Do you want to talk to Vecna about maybe melee hitting me?


You should have let me and Yasha pick you up.


Lady Kima, as I'm sure you know, grief speaks before sense.


Oh no. 12. Oh, double-double! That's better! 25.


I just look at them and I'm like, he got hit in the gut a few times.


Okay, Traveler, please let this work. I'm going to cast Polymorph on the dragon.


Yeah. Yes.


There's three of them!


Somebody tell Trinket.


You need to do that more, that's pretty good.


I look up and go, "Ooh, It's Monty's cousin."


19. Nice. That is 36.


I have a good feeling that this guy is a man of upstanding nature. I'm sure he'll keep it to himself.


I feel like you know the rest of this story, and I am at a disadvantage.


It's going to become that story that everyone hates.


Well, we probably want to set up shop for a while and wait for the dragons to come and leave and then strike, so that we've got some time.


In Santa Monica.


Can I assume that you would have already given us any advice by now if you knew a way? Are we stuck with our own resources?


Just weapons.


Sure, I can, but that seems like more of a medical thing.


What do you love, Sam?


Yeah. Ultimately our time is worth far more than our money, so-- let's just go with that.


Is there a tavern anywhere nearby?


Wait, I didn't say sharpshooter! I didn't say sharpshooter on that one, did I? I didn't clarify.


No?


The duck is my animal totem, you guys. I can explain that later.


Oh shit, Marisha's trying for this one?


About when this is happening, I pull the wire out of my coat and hold it into my palmed hands and Message to Nott. Nott, will you find an excuse to bring Beauregard and yourself to my room you saw me go into?


Wait, is Yasha going with Adella? No.


Even halved?


But he can carry it, right? Proof. You've got to trade it for the Dawnmartyr armor. Is there anything else left of him?


I don't do insight checks too often, I'm sorry. 22.


You're the last person in this room and on the internet.


We could leave word, I suppose.


That's not Voltron, man.


I didn't say anything.


I was helping!


Why did I write that down?


Fucking don't like this guy. I'm curious, where do you hail from? Are you from here?


I'm good.


Wait. How did he talk to you?


Can Scanlan Two heal himself?


How much of it are Frumpkin and I looking at? It's one little ditty or are we talking True Detective here?


That's enough to smear a lens.


(laughs) Shit just got real! And we're all just, we're stuck in the room now.


We've got 24 hours.


Do we go on to the next town, or do we try to--


What'd you find? What was it? What are you hiding? I want to know!


Doing okay. Not doing great, but I'm doing okay.


Do you know Sylas and Delilah are right there?


Are the globules of light around?


Oh-- but, wait wait wait wait. Doty's not going to get any advantage on this because he's been leaning against a door, right?


Tall. Strong.


Can I get a little bit closer? I can poke.


Do you sleep in the boob?


It doesn't have to be in front of you. It says in any direction.


I point it out to her.


Kingslayer.


Yeah, she's a villain, so you get to face off with her. It's really fun.


4d10? Holy shit! Do you need extra ones? Here's a gold one for you.


Genuine proof that they are perfectly fine killing a small peasant boy.


You just got punished for being too witty!


Could be cool for Grog. Boxing.


(quietly) What do we do? Charge in, guns blazing?


Oh, yeah! There's a Christmas episode.


I believe that you saw a dragon and I believe that it was white because you were in a blizzard. Right? Am I right?


(chuckles) It's better than--


Which makes me really nervous.


But you crack the opal, you put it in, it's like one hour of either flashlight, and then a little blinder to turn it on and off-- it's basically like a little train lantern.


Oh my god, 24! One more! So, 50 points.


Yeah, I can see in the dark, I'll look.


Avarice.


I think I can get him out.


Oh, it hits. Okay. One, seven, 17! Oh, 17 plus ten, so 27.


Oh, but that's only Grog in the front now.


I'm really obsessed on this ziggurat thing. Have you thrown any whitestone into the ziggurat?


Yeah. Yes, I am. I don't know what I'm doing, and I'm floundering a bit.


It's funny. I thought you were going to say something like, "Man, the Empire's sure fucked up." I was going to be like: Right? I was just thinking the same thing. It's just like what Jester said: we can read each other's thoughts.


Who needs money?


What about a wall from out from the side?


It's conscription.


This is dope, man! Yeah!


Oh god, it's a one.


And then I'm gonna go into fire elemental form and flame on.


I will say this, I know this for a fact, that it says in the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master will help you select a fey creature. (all yell)


♫ Takin' it to the hole ♫


I like a good loft position. Since I was a kid, my favorite thing.


Constitution saving throw? Why?


Cannonball, exclamation point. Cannonball.


Wonderful. This has been most helpful. Well, I thank you for your time. Are there any available docks for rent or for lease if we happen to come upon some vessels or ships?


All right. That's three, the fourth one was Primordial.


And to be super shitty, I grab a length of rope and wrap it around her ankles and tie it back to her hands so she can't stand up.


I mean, she's a goddess.


Okay, I'm going to pull out my new gun and take two shots.


Oh, the dagger, dude! It's a dagger!


You should try it if you haven't; it's quite delightful.


Oh, he's fucking trying to leave!


The spider is in between Fjord and Beau.


I'm going to let the trees know that we're here.


Do you know how much longer we need to continue on this path?


No-- I-- uh.


All right, we'll give it a go.


We will discover what she did.


Can I give him Guidance?


You're going to be alone for two full rounds with whatever this thing is.


Come on boy!


I don't know if I can.


Oh, that's right. Never mind.


That what? Detects a problem?


That's good to know, too.


(whispering) But it's next level shit.


About nine more.


Over Beau?


Hey Clay? Did you bury Tyriel Colsala here?


It occurs to me it was actually in the bag that Grog was holding.


The fuck?


(whispering) They're not saying anything.


Wow! That's amazing!


Does it get a multiattack, or does it just get one attack?


All right. How are you doing over there, gnomesies?


So, Oh! I'm an assassin too!


Oh, we do?


So, you said you travel the Ozmit Sea frequently, yeah?


I was waiting for the punchline.


Ol' Blemmy's over in the Silver Falls, that residential area. Do we want to go there, or--


I'll go halfsies.


May we seek audience with this Raven Queen?


If who hits me very hard?


It's translucent, like--


What does it-- did you look at it yet?


No, wait, that's wrong. No, 30.


Okay, what do we want to know?


We've dealt with this before.


Yes, good, right. So I'm walking. Is there anyone between the bookshelf and me, where I am? Is Fjord?


Like--


Okay. I'm going to tell them to attack his eyes.


Yeah! So should we dance in the street?


Like Clarota. Like (brain-sucking sound).


Roll! Roll again.


We jump in.


I'm sure that's how they feel. No one's ever sure they're doing the right thing.


I like the way you think. All right.


What should we do? Should we go home, then?


That is my voice.


Oh, that's pretty good. 19.


Come on, WC, come on!


We push it in harder.


Just because?


Are the guards still within earshot?


Floating about in the air with Pike's boots.


No, I don't have any of those. But it can be arranged if you are short. I can have my second here look into it for you.


Was that supposed to be a hawk? A pigeon? (pigeon cooing)


So you do intend to engage in a fight. Because otherwise I would say, I can go in, just sort of looking like you, and draw their attention.


Bad timing.


Crying on bosoms. (mock-crying) (all laugh)


(posh accent) Would that be considered piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage?


We still have to collapse the tunnel.


The twins!


To-may-to, to-mah-to.


Guys, we knocked it down a point!


No magic can happen in the orb.


Also, before we begin, I want to make sure that you know how serious we are in getting honesty from you. I take his head and I go whack-whack into the wall.


Yeah, we're kind of eatin' it in here.


Come on, let's go make asses out of ourselves!


Behind the scenes, I'm always constantly up his ass, trying to make Tiberius as OP as possible, and he's always stopping me a lot.


Is it carved out of the rock?


Oh, shit. So I go in that direction. Open the door and try and make my way that way.


I think they might, yep.


So we can both Fly?


I cast Counterspell.


Oh yeah. Hi, actually, I kind of-- You see this feminine-looking figure. Long black hair that covers almost the entire side of her left face, wearing a hood up, dark green cloak, black and green clothes, you can occasionally see green ribbons in her long hair. She is like: I'm really sorry to bother you guys, just-- I couldn't help but overhear some conversation you had last-- I'm sorry to be really forward. Are you heading into the swamp today?


Congratulations, I'm so happy for you.


Oh, so we stealth down the other hall, we try.


28? No, minus five. 23.


I don't know about this, I don't know about this. Aw, he's going home to his family.


There's smoke between us.


I'm grabbing Percy's arm and lowering him down lower because she's short.


(wheezing) Cliffs of Dagger Bay! Go ahead!


We all sit down and start knitting.


A d8.


So I'd have to cast it again. I only have one more level two spell because I don't have very many spells.


Which way should we head?


W.C.'s gone.


Well, whatever it is, the empire just got it back.


Right, I don't even tell anyone. I just start to slink down the steps.


Thank you. For everything.


We know nature is better at everything.


Well, maybe we should, now that we have the knock-Percy-out-in-case-of-emergency plan, should we have a revolution plan? Because we seem to be divided on that.


Shit. I'm going to run as far as I can into the open and see if I can see any of them, while I'm yelling: Where are they?


I seem them moving in that direction, and once again, poof for them.


Did you find anything good in this?


No, it's perfectly fine to stack graves. It's actually very efficient. It's a great way of using if you have a limited amount of space. Over time, you eventually end up doing that. That's common practice.


Whatever you're going to do, do it! I'm firing again.


I put on the goggles.


I send Frumpkin after her.


Another robe?


I need a full 100, what about you?


Where are we going, before our errands? Or after our errands? What's the destination?


Stay true to Percy.


Stitches are just stitches?


It's a real poster?


Eins! Zwei! Drei! He's forgotten all language.


What's on your head?


I put my little pinkie in it.


Aye, Captain.


How long has he been like this?


She's in a better place.


We shouldn't go down.


We seek passage through this marshland to what lies beyond it. We are searching for--


Can I make another perception check, please?


He wears this really cool cloak, and he's got an amazing voice. Actually, hold on! I pull out one of my pamphlets. Here, if you want to learn more, you just let me know.


He'll call? Okay.


Do you want to play some cards or something?


What! Got your bow!


Yeah, what about my Water Breathing--


What do you mean, you don't know? He just did the math.


Good addendum. Whatever that word is.


I'm going to do that.


Last time, Pike and I took it down with a couple of Earthquake spells.


Hey Nott, stab the floor really fast.


Yeah, kind of buff.


Give Matt a couple.


Big one, did you see that?


What is today in this world, DM?


Brimscythe?


I'm looking at them.


And that's five, six  that's 11 points of damage and five points of psychic damage, and a ten-foot push.


Percy, I think you and I are on Tiberius duty.


Oh good. How'd that go?


I am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here.


Make a distraction?


It's Trinket! It's Trinket!


It just looks like me, though.


He's friendly. That's my pet cat.


When Grog attacked with the trammel, it was a strength check?


When we descend, do we want light to be able to see? Or we don't want things to see us?


Meanwhile...


Fall over. And then?


His arms are still up?


Kick him off!


And they're speaking this whole time in Gnome?


I think our reservation's ready.


I'm not dead.


We do, we can float on.


You're not with us in our room right now!


Close your eyes.


(quietly) Fuck. (clears throat) What does it smell like?


I don't know what that is! (laughter)


Yes, she can.


I've heard many things about your knowledge of dragons.


I walk over.


And I will fulfill your request as a fellow member of this team.


The dice would, as well. Okay, great. All right.


It was far down there.


Don't give me the skull, but don't give him the skull either.


Your aura thingy with 15 feet should do it.


I've got it right here.


Let me actually try that. I Alter Self.


And then I was like, "I owe you a drink."


Oh. And that's not good? Don't worry, I've been raised around money, I know its worth. I have--


I would love to, while we're here, very quietly examine--


Boobies.


Whitestone is quite wonderful.


Can you fight and stuff in case shit goes down?


What, to mine?


The chest area?


I don't want to fucking bargain with this thing.


Okay, I'll take the-- oh! I'm going to take the torn piece and hide it under her bed. Then I have the letter left, the Knights of Requital letter. Where should I put this?


It's all right, it's all right. You know, the astral plane is tricky.


No effect.


You don't care.


Seriously, thank you.


Can I take the Control Water and jettison us all up like I did with Grog?


We're not there.


Yes please! (laughter)


Fucking doors! It's always doors!


That's right, you're inspired!


What the fuck is grabbing my hand?


You like these kids, Kiri?


All right. That's a 26.


All right, I'm having a peeky-poo.


Gil!


Who wants to help me with the one totally charred body?


You see what I mean? These people are fun!


Just on my wall?


You were going to go shopping.


Backing up against the wall. I'm not using Bad News, I'm going to use Retort, I'm going to try and, first thing I'm gonna do is use a bonus action to heal a little bit. Yeah. That's nine plus twelve, so that's 21. Figure that out when it's not my turn. Next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start shooting to try and get that bow out of his hands one more time.


We are in the central Cliffkeep


Well, it has to happen eventually.


That's 14 points?


I'm on the broom, yes.


(hums Dueling Banjos)


(sings) I shake it off.


Yeah, he's a squib!


If I slide down and slide?


Your dad's name is Bob?! (laughter)


Where we killed Kevdak.


I'm going to join Keyleth as well.


Oh, we'll still circularly argue about something.


Yep. Need to get it cleaned.


You're welcome, darling.


Your mind is a grandfather clock, you know that.


I know, but it's still a one!


Now am I over your shoulder in, like, the baby burping pose, or sitting on your shoulder?


What does it mean? The eyebrows!


Some days.


But I can still see--


This is terrible. Scanlan!


Come on, Percy. Big money, no whammies.


Two legendary actions?!


You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a-- you succeed at a wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 of necrotic.


Are you telling me I'll never compete in the roller derby again? (laughter)


Fail! It's only worked like once before!


I listen to her, too. She's got a lot of fun stories.


But did you see? I slew that-- slew? Slayed? Is slew a past tense of slay?


22. 21!


Yeah, so just wipe it out?


I'm going to use Cunning Action to hide.


No, don't try to-- No, don't capture him, that's a terrible idea!


If you wear clothes, is the deal null and void?


Was there beer downstairs? Was there ale?


"Ja, sure."


It's not a mare? I'm just checking.


You say the stained glass window was on which wall?


An intelligence check, because I'm an idiot.


Yeah. Look really carefully  coves, inlets, anything that might look like it might be hiding.


She's wanted to fly so much.


I take out the Flametongue Dagger and give myself some light.


Lost, as in--


Maybe they're like, oh yeah, Sun Tree I remember him, he got taken away as a seedling, but he was really great. How's he doing?


These are all bonus, though. Really, I can't do shit. I kind of suck.


I'm sure Rob Liefeld just got a nosebleed and he doesn't know why.


Are we going to leave some folks down here to--


Perhaps our feathered friend is a little more important than the horses and I could leave my threads around her room and she would be safe there. I would know if there was a problem.


This is-- Oh!


I'm very well-travelled and very old.


So-- and I heard about this mysterious Sluice entrance. This Sluice thing like--


Because you're good at sneaking.


You're going to take that bet?


Raven Queen sends her regards, fox!


He's shutting down. Someone do something quick.


I am a powerful magician.


Yeah, that was kind of my question. I just didn't want to ask outright.


Minus three. Ten.


I don't think any of us can fully understand. I think, if we did, then we would be gods.


Yes. You. You will come with me.


We have a map of the city, yes? I think it best to stay off the streets. Is it possible, Keyleth, to tunnel through the city, underneath it?


I'm going to run over and try and pull anything from Yenk.


Oh my god, I want to ride it around right now.


How long have you been working on it?


I am going to do the fire arrow thingy at it.


Does that sound like the smoke demon that we saw come out of Percy? Anything like that?


Sounds like shite, Caleb. There are much better books out there.


Okay. As a bonus action, I'm going to cast Sanctuary on Nott.


Oh. Why didn't you just say that?


Don't do anything. Look. Don't touch.


We will hang out up here and just be weird.


On we go to the rest of it!


You know you want to roll a halfling sorcerer, come on!


Charisma roll, persuasion, anything?


Oh, so you were lying.


Let's sleep in the mansion tonight.


Thorbir just keeps walking.


Oh, you have to look through his eyes.


Keep him busy. He likes slow jams.


I'm going to-- yeah.


Yeah, this is the south-- fountain feeds the--


The thing with the plate?


Handwriting.


Poor Grog!


I have sideburns!


I agree. Who knows? We can't be replacing someone corrupt with someone even worse.


Wait, I'm sorry, I need that one more time, but I'll get it.


Human growing in.


No! I tried talking to it and it didn't say anything.


Maybe I thought that was an unspoken thing.


Oh! Then never mind. I thought it was three different spells. I've already got an extra Lightning Bolt in there. I won't add to it, never mind.


What do I do to shake the fear?


It's an ear jar!


If you say Vax'ildan sent you, you might get 15.


I point my finger down at her as I'm about to shoot the arrow. As it shoots, I keep pointing at her like: How's it feel, bitch? How's it feel?


Is the Critical Role YouTube channel called "Critical Role" or "Crit Role"?


The bumper sticker.


Should we start bringing cherry bombs?


I was an asshole, Grog, I'm sorry. I would never, never replace you, ever. You're irreplaceable.


Ow! Then I have one more bonus action, right?


Iron-y!


Is he holding anything?


What's in the center?


Oh, I've still got them.


We have our hoodies, back in stock in shop.critrole.com. It's new and improved. Yeah, 2.0. This really awesome text was hand calligraphed? Calli-- how do you say it?


Well, there was this acid pit, right? And we all got on top of the carpet, like we do.


Well that's his own damn fault he has poofy sleeves.


His big arms are five feet? Like, these big-ass--


Okay. All right, I'll use my bonus action to hide.


Are there any people around?


Yeah, for you? Shitloads.


Four, because there were two pairs.


You're always with us, wherever we go.


That is 3d8 cold damage. That is-- ooh! 15 total.


Yeah, one of the bodies.


And she knows where we are. And what our plans are. And every inch of this place. Including this thing.


It's going to be so fucking great.


I will also sing for him a Song of Rest, which is just another d6.


Yasha does, and then the thing?


How do you not?


Yeah, maybe we send Frumpkin first.


The dragon's dead. We don't know if another one will come.


Super endearing with that black eye.


I bet I can figure the lock from the inside. And I open the door and it opens because it's unlocked.


Take out my sword and cut open her bonds. Get back! Run! And then, if I still have enough timing beyond that, I'd love to take a swipe at it with my sword.


I think hotboxing is now-- No?


I've never been over here before.


Yeah, it's the morning, still. Okay? Let's go.


Lord of the Wings, I would go there. Just as a side note. Morden-cayenne wings! Let's do it.


Can you get us in?


(yells) What are you doing?


I'm so far below you in the initiative, though.


Shrimp scampi. Butterfly shrimp.


So it's fire giant size.


First one is a 32. No it's not, it's a 33.


Damn it! I used luck and I rolled the same thing on both.


I actually was, actually.


How can I control the Mage Hand with a bonus action? Can I move it and grab with it, or just grab with it? It's very vague.


Oh yeah, Clarota, thanks for all the fucking help. (all laugh)


She already has plate armor.


Little hearts!


I mean, when I was in my earth elemental form, I got up underneath the tree, I mean, I feel like if we needed to, I can get inside of it.


I know, I think you've aged through the process.


Okay. It was worth a shot.


She'll light up the hole.


'Cause I did that with Grog and his bull helmet.


You said you haven't had your parents around for a while now? What happened to them?


All right. Vex.


I take out my other longsword. My Aberration Bane longsword.


Whoa, he's really pretty in that light, though.


Is this true? Both look similar, both seem--


15 plus eight is naturally 23.


I'm going to cast Circle of Teleportation in my room.


That's the dice, 34, so 68 plus seven is 75.


We're still pre-sleepy time?


Like poop, or a feather, or--


We've been in darkness so long.


Wait, who? All of us?


Oh fuck! Yasha runs over--


You have a robe.


Wait, dang it! I wanted to take some torture weapons!


To Vasselheim, then.


Yeah, I'm assuming I translated.


Finally? Although you are Taliesin Jaffe.


So I roll, where'd it go, I roll 4d6. I roll 4d6.


Yeah, but they don't know which direction we went.


Meeting of the minds.


Plus we've been traveling for what? About hour and a half, two hours now?


I believe him, I believe him.


(humming a Muzak version of "The Girl from Ipanema")


Does he ride-- is he as fast as a horse?


I'm following her!


You say that now, and then tomorrow some crazy person will show up at our door and want us to do something crazy and then we'll never have a free night again.


I am beginning to think this a little more than we came looking for, but we have traveled a ways.


He's gone nuts!


Plus my perception?


Don't teach him how to say it in Elvish.


(rattling)


It's where we would make our camp.


(laughs) All right. Keep walking.


I'm going to use Sharpshooter. That's a 21? That's 21.


Yeah, let the twins go ahead first.


Absolutely. He watches it all the time.


Well, we'll find out.


Oh snap!


I can keep flying up?


Yeah, do you hear that?


Yeah, that's what I'm saying, could I just use my movement and then wait?


(sighs) Ooh, that's so much better! 22!


Okay. On my second one, should I just try to attack him again, kill him? All right, I'm going to kill him, try to hit him again. 18?


To distract the dragon so you can dig.


Let's just fuckin' do it! (laughter)


Which ones are the bad ones?


I'm helping and as we do so I say  I don't know what's going to happen in the following hours. Do not go far from me. If we are out of earshot, you are too far from me. Do not go far from me.


I'm right behind you.


You're not hearing anything? No, like, super sexy (low-pitched growl) voice? Nothing?


Really? You don't have any dragon blood in you, do you?


Why?


He made both those checks okay?


I cast Flaming Sphere.


Pike, no! No, Pike!


I'm going to take my staff and jab it behind there, see if there's anything.


No, all these other people are helping this kid, so I guess I will too. Somebody better kill that big gnoll, though.


Yes. That's actually not a bad idea. Can we do that?


I make myself look like a weird hunchback, sort of, not all there.


Take your guilt trips and bring them back to dad. I don't need them.


Persistent rage. I'm raging balls this whole time.


While she's doing that, I'm going to take my staff and repair where it cracked.


What we would have done is face-planted on the stone floor.


What about my broom?


Let's make him invisible and get him to the mansion.


Thank you! 14 points.


I guess I'm always looking for a sign, now.


Yeah, I'll follow after his ass.


13? That's worse than it was before!


Oh my god. It's growing. Tell me your last rites before you burst, if it happens.


Does it retain the shape of the helmet?


Scanlan!


Let's really push the envelope of dick jokes.


Yeah. I think that everybody here thinks that this is their fault. Raise your hand if you think what happened yesterday was your fault.


Well, not literal wolves.


That is a ten plus four, 14 points of damage.


Negative two! (laughter)


No, he's married, remember?


Bouldergut saw everything, so unless we want to bribe Bouldergut--


So. I've seen you checking out some of the members of our little group, here.


I fixed a wheel.


Ooh. 20!


May he rest in bed sores for all eternity.


I wasn't laughing at you, I love your hair, okay.


I've just been staring at Allura.


Yep. They're just buzzing.


So he lost some points. But he has my hit points? What does he have? I'm looking, I'm looking. Sorry. I got it, you go on with your thing.


Wait, we healed the other game. Even with that?


You're not supposed to just come out and say it.


I will say, speaking as someone who has lost out on years of a relationship with someone I care deeply about, if you have someone out there that you love, you should tell that person, or, at least, tell someone about it. It's a weight that you're going to continue to bear, and you're going to miss out on months and years of either knowing or not knowing.


With a door floating in the air.


What kind of a wand?


No! Wow.


Where we kill it.


More is coming very soon. Very, very soon. Next batch is coming.


No, I don't want to move because he'll hit me. That would be bad. Who hasn't gone? You haven't gone.


Wait, we're going to sleep with this skull in our house?


I'm throwing my sword!


We should probably go check it out. But everyone wants to go to the Fire Plane, get some armor.


First Mate?


We can pay him back, it’s true.


The Feywild? Is it like another city?


And my perception. Vex, come up here and look around.


I hope they're friendly. He's definitely not as solitary as Sarenrae, is he?


Totally blind.


There'll probably be something siding closer to the waterfall, maybe.


Okay. We're good.


34 hits. The other two do not.


It's glued under the cloak.


Is that a Pike quilt?


You'll be fine. You're Grog. You got it.


Oh, he's huge. Maybe this was a mistake. I should have talked to him.


The stairs are back through the hall and up, right? They're not in these chambers? It's one big chamber?


Forever.


How's it feeling? Can I ask the tree how it's feeling, can I be like, "Hey tree. How are you doing today?"


Now there's a permanent hole there.


We did a lot today.


We should get that too.


We don’t know about any others.


I put my hand on top of yours. Thank you very much.


I'm going to go along the edge of the steps this way and come down toward it and I'm going to now spin and flames lick around it and I'll go (flick) and I flick that off my hand. This time is also not good. It is a 13.


Ugh! I got it.


We can do that. Let's cast Pass Without a Trace. I'm going to light up my sword.


Northwest.


So these ones are Fire.


Could you aim for his penis?


Hey, in the store tonight, we've got lots of--


Things he would have laid down for us. Stuff like that.


Will he get an attack of opportunity?


I should have. I made a wrong call.


And are the wings schlorped back in?


We had a bit of a list, we've had a couple lists, and we've checked an awful lot off of them, and we're real tired. We're thinking of taking it easy for a bit.


We'll make some money.


I thrive in cold places. Is this such a place?


As a sailor, apparently I'm able to acquire free passage on ships.


But it doesn't connect the newcomers to the new chosen.


(stuttering) It was a thing. I'm so sorry that Vecna found us. The ethereal thing was a backfire.


I was thinking mostly of the barracks or the Alcove.


No, dim light only.


He has 26 hit points.


Sure. We could do that.


Is Buttonbeard is real?


If I put my hands on that while you're putting your hands on the inside gems, it might open the doors, right?


Almost one-and-a-half times the distance I think, --ish.


Go, go! Six seconds, go! Go, go!


Grog could take the speed.


Don't go too far from me!


I don't know. A fist?


I'm going to go up to the bar.


I needed it right away. Right, right.


(laughs) Eh.


You told me, I swear!


Next thing I'm going to do, I'm going to cast Hex on him. Give him disadvantage on strength saving throws.


What? What did I do?


You have one. You have two, and then Avantika. I'm checking if you think that this could unleash Uk'otoa.


Whatever was keeping you in this cell, whatever was making you comfortable in here, be careful of it. There's something inside you that's trying to put you in a box. Whatever guilt you're feeling, whatever thing that you feel that you're to blame for, I would unload that burden. If not on us, on somebody, although we're happy to take it.


I give her one of the parchments.


You lead with the censer.


I did my dragonborn business and buried it. As we do.


Use those blue dice, those blue dice!


We're only, like, 23 away.


Kill that motherfucker!


Indeed.


That means everyone heard Beau and Keg bone, is what you're saying. [cheering]


Your Ashcan Pete makes me happy.


Was there an exit? Looking for an exit.


That's true. All right. I just think, outside of Vasselheim, you know, things come out at night, but whatever.


Are you guys friendly with each other?


You're welcome. I'm going to really quickly cast Eyes of the Grave. Are there any undead within 60 feet?


Yasha's going to run her ass onto the boat. Double dash, if she needs to.


I grapple onto her to hold her down.


You lost our flying carpet, you unconscious bastard!


Yeah, we've been, naturally, without alcohol.


(bad Scottish accent) Oh, hello. (group laughs)


Six points of damage on the first one, and 14 points of damage on the second one.


Thank you! Okay.


Only steal from grumpy people!


It works. The green was amazing.


I'm a two-foot-tall rogue, you motherfucker.


Lady Keyleth.


Ooh, so you get another strength bonus. You bump up one.


It's good garlic. Never can pay too-- Yeah, it's really nice garlic.


Towards the portal.


Six, Deathwalker's Ward.


Spends his entire turn.


They are not chicken bones.


Late fall!


You're too big.


Get it, von Bismarck!


(poof) All the soot and salt ignites, and then suddenly, whoa! What's it say?


Oh, it misses! (laughter)


You need 20s for attacks.


All right, you're in charge.


We got to get these shields down so that Vasselheim can actually have--


I'm super pissed off! Okay, okay, okay. Roll high on this one. That's good. 12 plus another six. That's 18.


Retrieve? God, I've been in the Underdark so long. What was the deal?


Do you want to grab any of the last bit of pastries for the day? Obviously, free treats today.


Oh man, that's totally weird.


She had a cat.


You've got to get picked up in like an hour.


Poutine.


This is so much!


Every book you read is tactical geniuses and strategy for days, but we just go in with nothing. Nothing at all. No backup plan, no exit strategy.


Threepio! Where could he be?!


It's not a pub town. And it's a place where you don't necessarily chat up new people, but maybe find some old ones.


(whistles)


All right, all right. Good, then let's just go divebomb with a big mouse.


And 25.


Am I heading the pub crawl?


I'm fucking sleeping.


Stockholm Syndrome?


It burrowed!


No! Don't!


Did I find anything on Smash-Face?


Yes! That's why I'm such a good painter.


No, she's in striking distance of the asshole. I'm getting her out of striking distance of the asshole. Okay! That's my move.


Is there a statue of the Allfather? The Allhammer guy?


I'll continue on.


You roll for Laura, because I shouldn't.


Just telling you. I'm just telling you.


It's a 16.


Oh my god, the zolezzo are going to come.


I was looking for traps, I don't think I found it with an 11.


Yes, and then another two because I'm going in halvsies on the cloak.


Yeah, and before he died, he gave me something that I think Dolan would want to have. Ulog, before Ulog died.


No, I’m neutral. Chaotic neutral.


I trust them.


Thanks, Grog. (laughter)


That's assuming we hit no pockets.


Oh my god, it's a 10!


Do you want me to do a reach-around, is that what you're asking me to do?


No, that's impressive, too.


I know. It's a very tough recipe, but I'm good at it.


That's all the conversation we can have in one action. No time to respond to that.


Pools of Wittebak.


Yeah! We have a thing.


That's not bad! I'll take that.


Stay on the ground.


Hourly flare-up.


I have crazy eyes.


Same thing.


(coughing)


I'm going to... Yeah, screw it, I'll do another Fireball at the illithid going away. Where do you think you're going? (fwoosh)


Nope. Ten.


Sorry. I thought we were bonding.


Little holy nuke.


Is it good and do we gain or lose hit points?


No, they're not. They're not going to let us go.


I think I can get us into that trap door.


Keep subscribing to Geek and Sundry, where you can watch Matt Mercer whisper at people.


My AC is 11.


Apparently, I only have to be here for another three days, which will be good.


And one of them would get an opportunity now because--


And if a slave can do that, that's pretty special.


Okay, so the door is open? Okay. Can I pop out? How close am I to either of the bad guys?


Maybe the person we're looking for is a giant.


Could I back up three squares, so that I could move to my left so I could get a straight look at him?


Deastok. So it's a bit Prussian?


Yeah, that's fine for the moment. For the moment, yeah. Get ready, we're going to do Mother's Love.


Oh man. (laughs) Talk it out.


Does that negate all my class boosting and all that?


We'll take care of you. Don't worry!


It's the other way--


We don't have many of those at the moment.


Okay, so with a split second and that erupted all around us, I have a moment to appreciate all of this angelic fucking flexing and taking all of that damage. I take out my superior healing potion, kiss Keyleth on the cheek, and feed her the potion. That's my action, my regular action.


She wants her weapons.


I'll check for traps.


I say, tastes like home. And I spit in his face and reach up and thunderclap both of his ears.


Follow me.


Oh, now we're carefree! Oh good, I love it!


My strength? Which is a plus five.


I like your jacket! It's really great.


I want ice cream!


(clicks tongue)


I get advantage on charisma rolls.


You'll take good care of him?


30-foot range.


Maybe it's ceremonial.


(giggling) I turn into an asshole. Were there any-- fuck, I really don't want to have to blow-- okay, so I'm going to---


All right, so. Have I got the door open yet?


I want to know.


Do you wanna hang out on the broom with me?


How far can I throw this fucking thing? Long range of 60 feet. The long range of 60 feet means that it would be a disadvantage throw?


Do you feel like the Empire, or the Lawmaster, is onto your group? Your Knights of Requital? Do they know your name?


But I don't know. I like broken things.


This is quite a good read!


Hey! Natural 20! Yeah, jazz hands work every fucking time!


How many swamp fishmen?


At advantage because of Enlarge.


You can take care of yourself. She made a hand. Can you do cool things?


Which way?


Plus we have the poo cell phone.


He did. (laughter)


Who else wants it?


Sh.


Crit on a 19!


I'm going to point out, because I took Tough--


Cleric shit!


Come join us.


It just says darkvision. I didn't write down the distance.


Why don't you two come join us?


I mean, I'm assuming-- I didn't go there to find anything, but I went just to think, and I didn't see anything by chance, no?


One of these.


I'm so glad someone wrote that down for us!


I gave her my fucking cloak, Matt.


I'm tying it to my sister right now. Come on.


Okay. Proficiency and dex. But disadvantage. Okay. 21.


Oh, wow. That's rare.


Lionel's way better.


Good call. Greater for Grog.


I say, okay, all right, enough hitting each other, enough of that.


Yeah. You know, I had that bad time yesterday, but probably different guards there and I have this cloak now so I'm going to--


Umber hulks?


Are we--


So foul.


I bend down--


For her.


No, I got bracers and I'm just fast as fuck.


I was about to go through them, do you want to help?


Horn of evil.


(sing) Clang, clang, clang! (laughter)


Yeah, sure off, go on. Fly off by yourself, nobody cares.


I'll sit with Grog and Pike.


All right. Then I'm going to come around the corner.


Oh! You've got that!


Yeah, that's probably good too.


Do you want to see it?


What is the distance from where we are to the terrace balcony space that they're on?


He's all right.


Great, wonderful.


Okay, so I will move. Can I make it to this?


Yeah, perceive it?


Wavy, okay.


All right, we should probably go.


Steal from the goliaths? That could work.


That's crazy talk.


She makes a valid point, actually. LAURA. Oh. If people are scared of carnivals, they won't want them in the future.


Oh, in the mansion, fuck, we'll sleep in the mansion.


Hugs and loves.


Whoa, that’s major.


Calming them down, looking for loot.


I'm not in the mood.


It was a d8?


I'm going to look around for boxes and interesting stuff. Bullets, black powder, any books.


You're going to use Luck now?!


It could fall.


Do you think it's the nostrils?


Do I see that big thing in the back?


About how many people does it look like-- I mean, how big is this camp?


Hey, Vax?


That old chestnut.


As we leave, I grab the bolt that he shot into the wall over Caleb's head.


But we might, wouldn't we?


(sighs) Okay. How did Pike roll?


Is it hot in here?


This is three.


It's just a pile of blue poop.


This grants an audience for all of us, then?


Let's talk about the killing part, though.


That was 12 points of damage.


Nabend.


Do you know why I titled your sister?


Are there any younger men that are--


How did they even get in? I take off to the front desk. (laughter)


So if he makes the portal, you have to get to the portal.


I'm going to lightning arrow him. Oh, I can't do that because I Hunter's Marked him.


This is why you shouldn't have thrown the snail.


How much do you think that roll weighs?


What do you mean, you need help?


They still be helping kids read and write and play D&D. It's amazing.


Let them enjoy their drink, please.


I know, I was going to say the same thing.


Shrubs?


Okay. I'll take the sparrow, jam it in there.


Oh, elven aging! Cougar!


Oh, here we go. (Liam and Taliesin laugh)


A little creepy, but a very good job.


That's 31 to hit, that hits. Nothing fancy on this one, obviously, just the old-fashioned-- 16 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage.


How's new management working out?


Is it the morning?


Can that ever be healed?


Yeah, we could just make it a fun time for them.


Oh! Like can I just in general?


Well it's not there, either.


Oh yeah! I'm resistant to cold, Travis just reminded me! I have cold resistance because of my Vorugal armor.


I like that it was not even a question.


Oh, that's it?


Getting ready where? What are we doing?


Okay. Five minute little fly-ahead?


Yeah, would we have heard anything about this in our studies?


Can you chill? Right here. Because this is where I am. Can we wait it out?


And I do Animal Shapes and I turn all of us to-- who's grappled? A lot of us. Right?


Goddamn it!


And you said there were three warriors?


Do you want to know his backstory? (laughter)


It's a dead end past all of this? It's a dead end and just goes up?


But Frumpkin will listen to you.


Jeff Lobey, thank you.


He's a defeatist, if I've ever seen it.


You're welcome, Gary Gygax.


Aw, come on, man.


Yeah. Should we proceed? What is all this dilly-dally?


Yeah, we gotta go.


No, but do you need to know something of what you are trying to locate? Or does it work on name alone?


I play Nadine. You should go see it.


(whispering dramatically) Yes, he's going to take it.


Remove Curse?


Shit. I turn to Gilda and Wallace and say: Look, I know another mouth to feed is a lot. It would mean a lot if you take her, but we'll help you out. I reach in and I give them 50 gold from my stash. Should be enough to help for a little bit. Hopefully make up the difference.


You know, friends are in town, he's showing us around.


I'm glad that's not you.


Is it cold in the city?


Okay, carpenter and--


That's all right. Second attack.


Okay. Well, good night, you two.


Yeah, it's beautiful.


Oh, very good. I'm going to throw the ice knife right there.


Not much. We were going to sample the different Trosts, and I wanted to maybe do some book browsing. Nothing major.


Sorro!


I cast Cure Wounds on Grog.


I'm going to double back to the group.


So 19 goes to 38, and then the damage gets added to that, right?


It did sound like you were fucking flirting.


Oh. I'll use my chalice.


One more day! (singing) One!


And what were we trying to get there? Another one of the articles of confederation?


I feel like I should hang back, probably. stealth-wise.


Well, it would take one person off this plane.


We'll work our way through in a montage.


Hey, DM.


What should we do? What should we do?


What language were you speaking?


Can't fucking earn a living in this land. Come up from a mile out of town, been trying to grow fucking carrots for these fucking people. Can't earn a living!


We should get some honey or something. I bet some honey on the lens would be a real pain in the ass.


Perhaps Nugget could live here and you could visit him when you come home.


If you'll check for traps.


(whispering) I'm really embarrassed. I'm really embarrassed.


And I cry out full voice, listen up, you walking prawn, doom has come for you today. Step forth, you slimy bastard.


Just occurred to me. It just occurred to me.


Give it to him.


That's quite wise. Please keep my jacket clean.


Have you talked to Cerkonos or Korren at all?


It's 30 feet. I'll use my bonus action to click my haste boots together.


To whom? We haven't ever sold them or come across anyone who wanted them before.


What are you holding your ear for?


Three charges, right? So I can use two?


Don't tell him.


Yeah, I'd like to try.


Put a piece of paper back together.


That's like nothing, really.


What if I cast at a higher level? Would that help?


That's not great. Oh! 20 total.


Motherfucker, but he'll still take some damage.


I stop and I get the golden tea set. And I take off after him.


I scritch Keyleth behind the ear, but nudge it aside with my toe and exit the room.


It hurts!


Get the fuck away from it, Keyleth!


I'm rolling to hit?


Because he moves.


Facepalm.


Look, a lot of people could go by the alter-ego Meat Man.


Yeah, I would really love a drink and I sit down next to him. What do you have? I need something heavier than a trost. I've had enough trosts to last me a lifetime.


We've done that. It sucked so much.


Well, did he just take them with him?


They're going to be waiting and expecting us, so if they think we're attacking one of the houses and then instead we attack the other while everyone's rushing to deal with what they think is the next attack, we attack the second home, and then when they prepare for us to attack the third home, that's when we attack the castle.


Please, let me know what you think.


Oh, Tyrell! I just remembered. (laughter)


Well, I was going to say that if you had to put one above the other. If you get one thing, you get to do it.


The tree is not giving off anything, no?


I call it back to me. I pull out of my purse a little set of tools on a ring, and I give it to the hand and whisper it off again to go see if it can pick the lock.


Excuse me, I saw in the middle of the fray-- Sir. Excuse me.


Very sweet.


Is it like one of those old kids toys where you use the magnet to pull the little filings up?


Should we run through?


Oh, I'm Marisha Ray, by the way.


Oh, and I want to learn the cantrip Guidance, but I don't know any good healers that can teach it to me.


But there was some talk of needing someone to take us through the sewers, and I can go fetch someone who knows the sewers.


It's not coming up?


Traps. I'm looking for traps.


Oh, hi. We're your new masters.


Evantica!


We're the worst.


We should drink those, first of all. That is the only thing that makes sense. And I feel-- and I apologize if it seems like I say this a lot, but I do have a castle that we can drop things at, and we can leave them there, perhaps get back to them at a later date.


You're weak, shouldn't we use a strong person?


Man-made tunnels that aren't going to bake us alive.


Put the bones down gently.


It's like a little--


Is it the quiet gun?


Actually, we may not need it yet. That may actually work out well once we've--


Some of us do.


The same one. Was there an area, a destination, a direction that you last knew that he was going? Is it in our interest to try and find him?


Through her bones?


No, but I'll see them when we get there.


Ah, we haven't gotten to that yet.


Anyone look familiar? Any uniforms that look recognizable?


Power move!


I mean, she's abrasive, but that has its uses. Right tool for the right job. Right Kiri?


You fuckers don't know shit.


Put him in a bodybag!


Don't worry, it's a friend, we'll bring her back soon.


I'm going to run in and try to do a little bit more damage in here. I'm coming in and taking three more shots. I caught it. It's all good. That one misses.


He's just sitting here, laughing.


I fire. We all fire!


Kaitiaki, Cerkonos.


Oh boy. Yeah, that's a two.


Take all your clothes off and then figure it out.


Just me. But I could get inside.


To see if I can actually do it?


Oh shit! Flying carpet! Ooh, shit, and add ten, y'all.


Go? Yeah.


You charged me an additional 200, but that was also giving you the glaive.


Hey, Sun Tree?


Sure. How you doing over there, Shakäste, with the gates-- the cage?


He hit me again because I took a long time. But my strength is really low. 14.


Okay, cool. Okay, so--


Can I like-- a free action to be like, Grog, I'm in the kraken! as a free action?


Dexterity what?


14. (laughter)


You know, I've got a lot of flexibility back and it feels stronger, but it doesn't look quite right.


The horses have better initiative than all of us.


Or any color, really.


Yep. Probably.


Or maybe Pumat would have some sort of a magical-encasing--


Maybe? Could be. Not sure.


If she's fooled by a fat Percy, she's surely fooled by a svelte Percy. Does she think she has Percy? What's going on?


Throw everything off the top. Break everything. Smash everything.


Get that barbarian's resistance.


Before we do that --


Honestly, I have no idea what's going on still. It's been a hard time in hell. It doesn't sound familiar, but I guess I know where my friends might be. I've got to get back and see if they're still alive, if they're still in there.


I do, I just hope that it was enough-- I just-- you know me.


It's a wisdom saving throw?


We stealth around the other side.


All three.


How do we get in contact with you when we know when we move and how?


This feels like a lot.


Yeah, I'll take one back.


What was it, like Silly Bean, and Sweet Chestnut?


Not cool.


Do we see bubbles in the water at all?


Do I roll for stealth?


The greed of the Crown, man.


I'm going to run over there.


Yeah, they have a dexterity saving throw.


Molly, ask her. We're at an impasse.


Which room?


It's gone?


Yeah, we'll be watching. We earmuffed Ronin for that, right?


You're more married than him.


What was the other number?


As an eel, I'm gonna swim around the big brown rock, away from the kraken, towards the door.


This is all happening in less than six seconds.


God, it probably looks like he's running in circles to us.


Oh. Come on, let me break it! It's obviously broken.


Heal yourself.


Actually this is wyvern skin. We use it in the air force of the Draconian army. And when the --


And I give it just a little squeeze.


Should we go try to cut it down? Without alerting them.


Wait, there's a rope?


Let's start by talking to our friends before we start investigating our allies.


The house feels a little exposed to me.


I'm just gonna roll the damage.


Percy, I need you to do something right now.


We only need to be so far out.


Just that? That's it?


But does he seem confident and happy is what I wanted to know.


I hang a note on the gate of the keep.


These ones are Fire, yes, so they're located in a volcanic region, and you can start to feel an energy from where the planes start to shift, and it gets a little unbalanced. That's where we each live, and I'm from the ones where we protect the Air portals.


I do, it's just... where.


Round one!


Yeah, but Seeker Asum knows all the ins and outs of the palace.


Maybe that's why it's protected. Maybe--


I was just looking, but you can take, okay.


Thanks. Could I pee on him and thaw him out, quickly?


I don't see or hear him, so I assume he is healing my sister right now, and I feel comforted.


He's really very nice and accommodating.


Yeah, I know, so I did okay. Five, six, seven, eight-- (counting) 24 points of damage.


Yeah. He's pretty surly, intimidating looking. He might have a half-elf with him.


Well, I have them, I just don't want to blow them.


Oh, she's winded, that's nice, that's nice.


Are these guys humans, these guards?


Trinket's in my locket.


The beetle bit you?


I don't know what else to do. If dragons attack, our five guards aren't going to be able to do anything.


I’m just so proud.


I'm sorry. I would have taken us home, but we were already there, and I had to go somewhere else.


Oh, Pike hit the other one.


I feel like we should hop down into the pit.


That is a ten.


You seem attached to it. I want it. I'll have it.


You're killing me!


I love that that's what we're calling it.


I need to go to the temple of the Raven Queen.


That would take out the lot of them?


You're not in a boat with us.


Words.


It's nice to see another firbolg out in the world doing something, and you seem like you're really building something great here. This is spectacular.


No line of credit, we’ll pay for it outright in cold hard platinum.


And second time, 19 for the second attack.


We're here to help. I promise.


No, I'm going to help-- no, I'll see you in a bit.


Then we're going to the Feywild! And we all hold hands--


Maybe soon, yeah.


Plus two, so 38 is 40.


But it's not on us yet. Oh look, now you can see us.


I think I have a little oil, if you need it. As a sign of good faith. Didn't we get oil at some point?


I hold it out like a microphone and go--


I feel like we need to retire the dice.


Are we on the edge of a ledge or a wall?


Good job, Beau.


Smoke him!


What were you doing?


I’m going to grapple that dick.


Who's got questions for Peg-Leg over here?


15. That’s still acrobatics, right?


I'm having a heart attack right now.


I'm sticking with everybody, and let me take one-- where am I? Let me take like a step back and hold my action there.


Yep. (laughter)


Okay, so four. I'm going to use Luck. 19 for the second, so that's 19 plus 13, so I'm pretty sure I succeed.


And we call, I go, Grog!


Into the group?!


And we're not dead.


We're trying to remember the fake geography--


I stay right where I am.


Yeah, someone will add some effects at some point.


Yeah, death was not pleasant.


Well, yeah, just a little. There were fucking treasure troves in there. Not that I'm interested in that. I'm all for playing it safe. Measured. Practical. That's my middle name. Fjord Practical--


Hopefully the whole time.


Yeah, I place the elf owl back on Beauregard's shoulder and go to sleep.


May I take that and fly up? I swear I'll give it back.


We'll be picadors, right? They put the darts on the back of the bull to soften it up and (whoosh) killing blow!


What? Strength?


We're at a reef!


Just within, right. That's what I thought, and I'm going to throw three daggers at his fuckin' eyeball.


Okay, yeah, I'm pushing the water, parting it, giving us a little.


I am feeling greedy.


All right, but hear me out. Because we fought those people in the swamp, they were the merrow people, right? Maybe they're still worshiping the same type of serpentine deity.


Did all Caleb hear with Comprehend Languages is swear words?


It's a long shot. We are on the--


I thought we fixed-- did we fix that? Did we fix the black sphere?


Do we see any mermaids?


Maybe we should go.


We don't know that we're going through solid earth. It could be sitting in a foot-deep puddle of muck in a cavern somewhere. It's not like it was teleported into a solid mountain.


Those are mine. I found them.


Okay, that's a good idea. I hate ticking, or repetitive noises. That's so obnoxious.


That's a plus, you guys! Going in the wintertime kind of sucks.


You, you're the sailor.


That's what they say.


Snake temple key! It says it right here on the equipment list. Jester has it!


Like a 1980s Halloween mask?


So you want to find Sabian and hope that he has the answers?


Yes, I can go invisible.


That's one better than before!


Do we get free attacks on him? (laughter)


Return to Palac Lusterka and present yourself to my sisters. Let them see what good it will do them to hunt me.


I love you. Perception check. Investigation for traps? Yeah. That is a 25.


Jester rolled an eight.


Okay! So seeing Vax go over the table and being like, "That was cool," I'm also going to be like (grunts) over the table. I'm going to join the Dukes of Hazzard train.


It depends on what we say.


I'll use Healing Word on myself at third level. So that's two, 3d4 plus five, right? Ten, ten plus five. Ten plus five. Okay, 15. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, I'll take that.


Okay, I'm going to take my staff-- after I threw my sword, I'm going to crack it in the nuts and crack it over the top.


I don't know if that house is cooked enough, man.


Is that your lying voice?


Which ship?


Can we float up a little bit and see if we can see movement in the trees where it is?


Is the giant in melee? Would I get sneak attack damage or no? He's not engaged with anybody right now.


I would be horrified if you were taking yourself too seriously.


I'll go to the kitchen and put the kettle on. I think sometimes you're running toward something so fast that you don't remember why you were running in the first place. I've had some moments like that with these people a couple times, where I felt distant from what's important. Recently, I've been thinking about this river in the northern forest. It's not a big river. You watch the river, and every year it's a little different. We used to make little leaf boats and put them down and watch them, and every year it was a different path, but it's all going to end up in the ocean eventually. I think that you're going to be ending up in your destination real soon. I think we're barreling toward it. Congratulations. I'm going to go make tea. (sighs) And I go make tea.


What happened? Why are we doing this?


She will be there.


Aye, but he's out here on his own in the cold. Ravenites everywhere!


Yeah, fan out. Who wants to move towards it with me?


So we get to meet the Meat Man?


You're in another plane.


Just don't put it on because you think it will be fun.


No talk of his father at all, right--


Fuck him up, babe!


Is that however long your--


-- you know, go.


I don't know. I'm not sure. Maybe. Could be.


Yeah, we'll take it. 23.


How about don't do that.


Okay. You want to shot put this one?


So we basically would just carry him around as a coat-rack.


Best way to build a Blood Hunter? Activate Critical Role content on DNDBeyond.com! Best supporting actor? Sam Riegel. Best job opening at a D&D-related internet company? Front-End Developer. I guess they're looking for a front-end developer. Someone will put a URL somewhere on here.


Just so light doesn't leak out.


We can just be there, they don't care? Oh. I was shooting guns today.


They like to get high!


We can get an extra room.


Here's the stone.


Yeah. The world does need an asshole. We'll work on that one together. We'll work on that. That's good, that's good.


I don't think so. Might be unwise.


I want to assist her, though. Can we get him further if I assist? That was the whole point of me doing that.


I can try to arrow them out too.


That was fun, you guys. That was fun.


Wait, what? It's skin books?


Got to do business.


But maybe I'm really good at it, you don't know!


And we are hanging back at this point but not in the thick of it. We're seeing this all from a distance? I was thinking about spells. Yeah.


Can I take a look around and do a perception check to see if anyone else might be watching us?


But nothing under the surface? Nothing breaking the surface tension of the water?


Oh, you-- yeah, right.


Is there poo on it?


When do we do the cat?


Sulfuric?


That was handed to us two minutes ago.


Yeah, I mean, I guess I'll attack at this point.


These guys are right here, essentially?


Fuck. Then I'll head back to The Leaky Tap.


(clears throat) No. High rats. There were rats on the top of the mast and we took care of them.


Right. But the eyes glowed.


Mass Anti-hold.


Run, Crapper, run!


Okay, then well, maybe I won't run in that direction. I run in the other direction and down-- yeah. So I can see.


Scanlan. Scanlan, do you still have that deity, that little idol of Pike?


You're right by the gold!


And how, was it in a fight?


I know Deep Speech.


See? Just easy as that.


Well given that he left them in the middle of the road-- think this is his second warning? Third? Fourth?


Oh, I'm reverting, too. I'm a follower.


I mean, we'll set up shop and only sell to him.


I want it to be far away to where there's a tunnel and then make a circle around it.


We can already announce that next Thursday at the midpoint--


Okay, so I just brought him down. Do I do any damage?


Isn't Wish instantaneous?


Okay, so you get hit with 2d8.


You're just going to pick his body off?


Well, I think the thing to do here, I mean, it just makes sense, is that if you leave the room for any reason, we send Frumpkin to the ship. They see Frumpkin, they know it's time to--


Inverted sit-ups--


Those notes are written on her Pathfinder sheet, tucked in.


I drew a three, and a three, and a three.


But I would assume if we said, "we're taking the book", that would mean--


I think it was 1d8, actually.


(stuttering) Money? Kraghammer?


Can I figure out what happened just by looking at him?


Sure, but we're just walking here.


Time is passing, because he's not that quick.


Is the glowy window within 60 feet?


We can do both.


Yes! 17, plus four, so that's 21, plus 3d10. 14.


I'm sorry. What brings you fine folk into town? Are you just visiting Pike here?


What's your modifier, negative two?


Sir Kerrion's body?


Ten to five?


I gave her silver!


You can't up a bonus action to an action?


Vasselheim is so far away, and the Feywild is so very close.


Yes. With conviction, I firmly believe that this is the correct book.


13. I add nothing to it, right?


Yeah, you guys should try it.


All right. Let's make a hole and go in, and then we can camp the night inside.


Is there a road to follow, or is it just a direction?


All right, they're okay. They seem unaware, which is very disheartening on a few levels.


So you're asking if we would like to pool our resources for a handful of these diamonds for a perilous situation?


Look for invisible peoples in the room.


Vax? You looked at Vax?


You were already stealthed, though.


Can I come here? Kind of behind?


Do they appear to be raven feathers?


I just realized I have the other half of the stone. The traveling stone.


Nott the Brave!


I give him a pat on the cheek.


Polymorph him, please.


I will do Bigby's Hand, and it's a concentration spell so Polymorph would drop for Grog.


I got a two total. But I get advantage against magic.


And books! Frumpkin, what are you doing? I put Frumpkin on my shoulder. I rolled a natural 19, so 24.


They're assholes, don't touch them.


(sings Yakety Sax)


We don't know. It could make it stronger.


So this is a bit of a problem because nobody thought of the dog and that's why I knew it was a bad decision to purchase it in the first place. Because now we are stuck with a dog. So what do we do Caduceus? What do you think?


Stupid Pathfinder.


Fire hydrant.


They adopted a dragon?


Stand her up.


Have we seen anything suspicious from the deals, or the--


(whispers) Don't stab any of the other kids, okay?


The crate is full of boxes?


Oh, dear god almighty. Okay. Thank you.


Don't you get sneak attack damage?


Poison, charm-- what was it?


Hey, can you cast Pass Without a Trace on me?


Wait, before he walks away. How long have you owned this space?


It is only 30 feet.


But we have a carpet now!


Quagmire.


Yeah, well, you choose to do that.


I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself.


I know. Selina Ruthe, who did additional photography, and she also does stuff every day.


Whatever you need, we are going to make it happen.


I'll take a step to my left, so I'm not in the same line of fire as Percy.


That set looks killer!


Get out of her view?


I wish that was Lorenzo's voice.


Wait, does Kiri get a turn?


I've got you, too.


We're not sneaking, then? 'Cause if we did sneak, we could-- Don't you have Fly or something?


I would have saved the world, that's what would have happened. Fucking one.


Mine is a waterbed, so be careful.


That's 25.


Oh, I have sprinter's boots! I have sprinter's boots. Okay, so I'm gonna use my sprinter's boots. I can-- While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action, and click the boots' heels together, if you do, the boots double your walking speed for one minute.


I'm not going to go to the front anymore, guys.


It's cancer. It's been a weird weeknight.


Yeah, we did get pretty far.


Well, I want to figure out if she's just another matchmaker or keeping it for herself if that is a thing.


Do they break?


Oh, okay. Okay.


(sighs) I'm afraid what will happen if I say yes.


Can we grab onto him for a reaction?


Oh yeah, this is an amphibious assault.


No shadow underneath us?


I cast Feather Fall on myself, on Nott, on Jester, on Beauregard, and on Fjord.


And they won't react then? It's-- this is our mission, to kill these dragons.


I scootch up ahead of Grog like, excuse me, excuse me.


This is my gun.


Where should we stay tonight?


Right! And you kind of think about it for a second and you entertain it, and then you feel really gross about yourself.


Is it written on a piece of paper?


But that's a lucky number.


(sings) Highway to the danger zone.


And that's not weird?


I'm going to take a moment to look through the sand and rocks and see if there's anything interesting.


He wasn't going to kill-- Were you going to kill them, Grog?


The one right over there?


Yes. And so I went to the local "shoppe" and purchased a bag of holding because I realized that I did not hold my own wheel of mending for a long time.


Seven, so 38.


No. There is, on the other hand, fine comedy about to happen.


Yeah. No, add ten.


We've all learned what happens when I get two points of exhaustion. Good things.


No, we don't all run out, they're stone, we have to drag them out, yeah.


Shit. Okay, I'll go inside.


You don't get to know until you ask offscreen.


I'm, for the record, not wearing the cloak when we do this.


Yoga pose. Medusa.


We came here for the two of you. What are you after?


Ugh! I hate her.


I'm going to back up a little further to get--


That's a small-- that's a dire armadillo. That's okay.


I probably should spend Grit.


Before we leave, is there anywhere in town that there would be a courier service where I could send a message?


You made it!


Do we lose hit points from this meal?


I did something that... I did something that wasn't the right thing to do, according to my tribe.


How far away am I from the stones? From the platform?


I send up my purple flare, too.


Yes, they're both 16s.


But does she believe that she's a zealot, like connected to some god.


It's rather stuffy in here, so we should open a window. I'll run up to right in front of Vex and slap a window on the wall.


I do not sense a thing?


I think he's hitting on her. I can't tell, but--


And we gained another plus ten, so now we have plus 20 to all of our stealth, by the way, from that Hide in Plain Sight.


I would love for you to take a look at it, Shaun.


Shut up, baby. I know it.


Caleb, look at this picture of you in Jester's book. It's really funny.


I go to the corner-- the highest shelf, I don't fucking know. These are probably all fake wine anyway. I fly up and grab the one on the highest shelf and fly back down.


Turn Trinket into a--


I know, I'm going to die, I'm going to fall and die if I get knocked off this fucking broom.


With her 20, she saw!


We gotta get so wasted.


No, they know we're here.


You are five? That's wonderful. Does your dad take good care of you?


(whispers) Four individuals. Huddled around. They're either the assholes or hostages, it's hard to say.


The lined of scrimmage.


Oh yeah, I saw your picture.


He called you a baby a lot?


I don't see how that's any better.


This is a sight better than the Nine Hells.


We're not religious people. We can't summon the gods willy-nilly.


Yeah, but I cast Stoneskin on myself.


And nobody ever drank that?


Are we going to go back and see them again? Okay, we'll just say: next morning, then you go say, "hey, we got an awesome thing for you." Okay.


She's in the room.


Don't waste any paint, but yes!


Small words.


I'm going to do Hunter's Mark on the damaged one.


A soul asylum?


Okay, I come over there and see what the-- what just happened.


In the Menagerie Coast tipping, five percent? Ten percent?


Just say, I'm sorry, what's your name?


20 for me.


I like chips.


I'm going to stay behind.


She can poof from within the mansion.


They see through invisibility.


Okay, so I'm going to check one of those out. See if it's any different than what we passed in that hallway.


I fully support it. Whatever you need to do to feel better, man.


My arrows in the Bag of Holding.


80 for the first.


So, like, you could die?


I'm at one hit point, I understand.


Frumpkin point two.


Well here's, oh wait wait, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, this might be crazy-- wonder what would happen if I drank that weird yellowish potion? While I'm a monster?


Doty? Do you know how to find Tary?


Someday I'm sure you will.


It went great.


I vote for-- For another day here.


That's all I need. They will send me fecal matter, and it's on you.


I am a walking crash test dummy. I mean, we can try it. It'll be fine.


What if she's wearing the hat? What if the hat is on her head?


We've got to get Kima out.


Question. You said there were eight bodies?


Aaah, the lava, I can't concentrate!


(singsong) Live at seven p.m.!


Wait, who wandered in here before?


18 plus 10 for Great Weapon Master. 28. 30.


But that's a lot of resistance to a lot of things. And 26 is... that's really strong.


Yeah. Hopefully Wilhand's watching over him right now, actually.


You just talk to me. You hold Frumpkin. Just keep your hands full with Frumpkin, okay? Hold my cat, okay?


Oh! Yeah, forgot you can do that.


No, I got interrupted. That's a good idea, thanks for the reminder, Percy.


Thank you, Pike.


Reminding everyone that we have all seen each other naked.


Yeah, something's going on here.


Or to leave.


Oh my god, you're amazing.


Just a reminder.


(laughs) 'It's like natural.'


I thought she was undead, just figured.


Gilmore's awesome.


But only tiny bits.


I would like to take out a grappling hook and grab onto the inside lining of the stomach.


We're losing subscribers in Europe right now.


What is Foresight?


Sure! Some us can.


That doesn't exist, right?


This must be the bright light that everyone sees when they die.


When we get far away from the carnival, we should drop the guard bodies off. Push them out so it looks like they were on patrol when they turned into zombies. Far away from the carnival.


Yeah. I'll stay behind.


I have rolled a zwanzig, that is twenty.


I'm gonna be-- Can I be like halfway in between on the bridge? Is that a bad idea?


Do you? It makes music. You like music.


That's not what we mean, you know that, come on. Just give us free stuff. (laughter)


It's a small room.


Do you want to hear the song again? (groaning)


My potential? What are you asking of me?


Okay, from his papa.


So ten.


Yeah, no deal, okay.


Oh! It's me! Oh dear god. Okay. I am going to do what worked really well last time, and I'm going to do a 4th-level Blight. And what I want to do is, I want to take my staff, because I'm near him, right?


They look undead. Doesn't--


Can I tell how he died?


Fjord swallowed a ball, and it's inside of him now, and he doesn't know what's going on, so--


Yasha didn't. Not that I remember.


Something behind the ogres.


All right, this could be really bad. I mean, we're about to put the dungeons in Dungeons and Dragons.


It's 20 and an 18, that's pretty good.


That's great, because you're badass.


I figured an environment like this might lend to something.


Caramel. Caramel. Ow.


Since you're captain now, right? You're captain?


I think it's a giant target on our backs right now.


We're drunk, we will talk about you in third person as much as we want.


27 on the third one.


He's got a talking sword!


All taken.


Yeah, what am I at?


I start in that same distance from him, the same radial distance, I start walking to my right. My full speed.


How does he get through all the dead?


Is it steaming in the early morning cold?


Let's go, let's keep going. Oh, what?


Nor in your closet.


Do you have a little bit more--?


Thank you, Becca.


Does he look like the description that we got?


Your girlfriend's on the ground.


I'm on her shoulders, I'm up against this fucking wall! You're doing this, I'm going to try and (grunt)--


You don't know where that's been! And trust me, I do.


It took me months to figure out how to build.


I'm going to catch up with the ladies and acrobatics over to them.


I'm going to wipe it away.


Your AC!


Oh, craft night!


No, it's in Percy's workshop.


Anything off the belt, in the back pocket?


Come on, winner winner.


And I yell-- Can I yell out "surrender" in Undercommon?


Oh, I bet something was sitting in the tree maybe and was keeping still. That could be it. Can I look down underneath us and see if the trees are kind of staying put where we are?


I did try looking for Scanlan at one point.


(laughs) Like a trailing fart.


How will we get back?


They're super soft.


Focus on--


That's the worst.


Yeah, Vax is rolling down the corpse of the hydra to stand in front of these strangers.


Shit! (laughter)


That is a question for the ages, isn't it? (laughter)


The fiend?


He's under contract, which means that there are places and things he might be able to help us with.


It could be a sinkhole. It could lead to--


Would they kill you on sight if they saw you?


Did she?


Oh, no...


Took about 1.5 seconds to fuck with Matt's name.


You did better than your mom. Yeah.


I can create water. Don't say it like it's cool.


I think we're doing this a bit prematurely.


Can we get in it?


(gulp) (gulp) Yep, yeah, that's good. That was impressive. I mean, you pass the test, sir.


What if you--


Can you pick me up earmuffs?


Okay. I'd like to use my bonus action to throw the next--


We have torches.


I should have moved! (laughter)


"Got it." I go upstairs with Percy.


Uriel, we'll leave you to your business, but if you need any help finding anyone, we're here for you.


No, they left me. (all laugh)


Let's continue on as fast as possible.


Stay with Clarota, I'm gonna go take a look, Scanlan, come on.


I know, I'm being an asshole.


Mr. Mollymauk?


It's more just an energy shield.


Should I kill her?


You can come up now, Caleb.


For the boat?


It's a teddy bear. It's a giant teddy bear.


I'm terrible at math. Not Vax.


Yes! Strength and honor!


You've got two minutes.


Female?


What we saw down there in the platinum mines was the 230,000 gold that we owe you times ten. Times 20. What we've just done for you has given you access to as much money as you could ever want, and I feel that's valuable. My family will require a bit of spending money to get ourselves back on our feet. We are... accustomed to a lifestyle, and we'd like to maintain it for a little while at least. I'd say 50,000 gold should be about enough to last us for a year or two.


(chuckles) Hence forge, right?


It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. We can testify.


Inspired. Use it!


I think they clash a bit, but--


They all know each other, I knew it!


No, no, no. My mouth is too small for a human jaw to make perfect contact.


That was almost great.


Oh, okay. You'll know your mansion better.


Get some breakfast, I guess?


What book are you reading?


In Kraghammer, yes, but there is 25,000 gold waiting for us, so that's always an option.


You don't roll a d20 for hit points, Sam!


I grab the whole chest. Is it heavy?


And I will turn to Vax this time and inspire him, and I will say, (singing) Kill that monk-y douchebag, white boy. Kill that monk-y douchebag right. Take out your daggers and kill that monk-y douchebag 'til he dies. (laughter)


We're going to go to Pumat's as well.


I'll cast Mage Hand from afar and try to unlock the big box.


Yeah, let's do it. We're totally tough.


(Woody Woodpecker laugh)


Something that makes me really cool.


Was she pretty?


That's short for Vax'ildan.


Towards the top?


We did not.


They took the cart.


Do we have any concept of what time it is in this perpetual night?


Would you say it's a beautiful sight?


Scanlan, whatever you're going to do, I want you to get ready to do it.


Try the wheel first.


Oh, advantage, yay, I love you.


We're just going to fling them off of the roof?


And then as a bonus action, I'm going to Hunter's Mark. Who looks the strongest?


Yeah. Maybe that guard got his job back.


It's a demon.


That is a very fair point, Jarett.


(whispers) Well, shit.


He said he moved within 60 feet of them.


(singing) Like a rogue!


Tary, dear. Darling. They don't treat her very well, and they'll use her, and they'll stay here and keep taking advantage of her, and we don't want that.


We have really good pets.


Oh. Okay. So you guys are together?


Could I have inspired him?


Everyone was a little thrown by what happened.


I run up to him and very subtly say, I'd like a hundred against Grog, please. (laughter)


From the next one.


We're holding on our Freedom of Movement, right? We decided that? Until we get higher?


I don't know, sure sounded like we were being shamed. "They're not wearing any weapons, they're just here for ceremonial reasons."


So that's my action, but if I now spend an action surge, I can get an action?


I'm very quickly going to craft something super simple.


Fair call.


Can I make a knowledge test to see if I would know what this is?


What is it, persuasion?


Yeah, eight gallons.


It's like being on a ship forever.


Rawr!


It was Hala?


Well, we should kill it.


(whispers) Traps!


Well, he said, like, "She thought I was dead, but my queen--"


I want a bone necklace, but do you guys recognize any of these tent colors?


Waiting to come back through. We could plant some contraband on one of those carts. In the kerfuffle, they'll be like, "Hey, you! You guys are arrested, you're under arrest!" And we'll be like, "Oh, we'll just skate through."


I have to applaud.


It's true. Maybe scry on Lockheed.


So have you slain-- have you had any battle experience at all?


Only attack if truly necessary.


It's people! And I'm going to find the most interesting spine and I'm going to turn to the first. Birth. Death.


No, they don't know we're here.


That little chunky thing?


Can I also get another healer's kit? If you have one.


Did you both roll?


Yes, do we have lodging?


Or I would have taken the Deck and been like--


You want to put back one of those platinums?


No. Unless he is knowledgeable about dragons. I was going to ask you where should we go to ask who might know things about the woods, about the wilds, about where dragons might keep?


Back at him, yeah.


Nine points with the Uncanny Dodge.


We chain him up!


I go over to Molly's body.


Oh yeah, the guy that you put in the shackles.


Anybody else coming to the Invulnerable Vagrant besides the three of us? Yep, four.


Yeah, I want to start a commune in nature.


I was gonna see if they're in the--


It's kinda crap, but it's kinda great.


Okay. Let me know.


Thanks?


I thought it was a group spell. Is it not?


Lots of pockets to pick!


Thank you guys, we love it, cupcakes! Happy birthday.


We can always bring you back.


Let's make him look like a goliath that wears a lot of robes because he was horribly scarred.


Who's the Gentleman.


We've got food for days.


Okay, so first thing I do is lean down and pick up the snail off the ground and say, "Hey, um, go fuck yourself." And then I throw him into the waterfall.


Who's got one awesome shot?


Where's Yasha? She's gone too.


How big is the entrance into that little, unfinished--


Oh, murdering children again.


We can't fight them! We can't fight them.


Right, so we don't really - oh, we can take hit points.


It's all right. It's okay.


I take the Gauntlets and I smash them together, and I grow in size. (laughter)


Sure. Rummy gin? Gin rummy? Pinochle?


We should rehearse. We don't know when we're going to need the dance yet.


He looked over at Ophelia. It was very suspicious.


I had a really bad day. I had a really bad day.


So did I. (laughter)


We can see the sky and we're causing the collapse behind us? We're up at Thar Amphala? Can we slow down at all, or do we have to keep booking it to avoid the cave-in?


I also stay up with Percy.


Here, M. Nein? (whistles)


Could you do that?


That was 6d6.


Are they bars?


Toucan? With a belly?


Have you prayed to Sarenrae?


What was?


I can transform into beasts. They have to be beasts.


What's the one where you wiggle? Is that power walking?


Yep. A couple of them have been upstairs, if you know what I mean.


She does, Grog.


All right, well, we know where one is. Where are these leathers, then? From the Raven Queen, we need to figure out where the Marrowglade Loch is?


I hope so.


Well, shit.


Yes, I could. I could. Okay, okay. This is exciting, this is so exciting, nothing's working. Okay, yes, I will go toward it 500 feet.


Beauregard, let me see this.


Oh! Well, that sounds fun. I like friends.


None of us have it.


Guard! One of you, could you go get us some food? We're very hungry.


I must say, I am having a wonderful time.


Well technically. We already did.


Careful where you aim that. You might break a camera.


A one!


That's another one.


How far north have you been, Tary?


Y'all mind if we take a short rest or something?


Plus your persuasion.


Also 14.


Yeah, we send them back towards the camp zone, right?


Could I ask, the roof that is underneath She-Devil Wonder Woman? How high would it be for Grog to jump using his amazing leaping things?


So wait, who are you guys again?


Was that bad? Should I have not attacked him?


Cobalt Soul's got your back too.


Yeah, because I have that book that helps me do that now.


Scanlan's back.


Here's your helmet back.


Someone else whose name I will not say out loud for now.


Okay. You three. Nott, do you want to come to the Wharfmaster so you can take a swim?


Well, we don't have any range.


Speak fast. Before I kill you.


Beforehand, yeah.


It's like our first game ever.


Yep, I'm going to stay here and just be on this guy.


The cough.


Why doesn't it reason with me, is what I'm asking! It could reason with me!


(sighs) Okay.


Don't want to be fighting you.


I will also say I'm at least going to back up to the side of the boat where I'm far enough away from that thing as humanly possible.


You're not going to slip me the digit, are you?


I take off my very prized circlet that I love oh so much.


It looks really cool.


I'll flick him in the forehead.


I'm still outside on my horse. So I'm going to ride around to the back of the house, and see if I see anything.


Okay. (laughs) 25.


Did you want to go see Enchanter Pumat Sol?


Look, I'll be fine. I'll make sure she's occupied.


Ermahgod.


You know who defeated ours? Pike, because she's the fucking bomb.


There's too many dice to roll, Marisha.


Guess what, Molly.


Okay, listen. Leave me behind, I'll follow the party with the hostages, I'll see where they go. Don't worry, I'll be invisible. Go back, tell our fellows, get them across the bridge, and we'll meet here in about an hour.


I'm seeing this all in slow motion.


I've been watching.


Does my luck transfer to anybody? No.


19. Doesn't hit. Next one is 29.


Reckless on el vine.


I'm so tense right now.


Two away, you know what, I'm guessing this is, we're going to get that before I even get back to my seat, so we're going to go do the giveaway. It's the shirt, the dice, the handbook, and the starter set. The handbook and the shirt will be signed by the cast.


Yeehaw! (laughter)


We should split the dog, and we can have a pet together, and he can room with us whenever we go anywhere. And then you can get your owl--


But we're not looking for Marius LePual, we're looking for Al Gore!


Please defeat this door.


It's possible that will happen.


I check to make sure the skull is still there.


We point at the ale and give him a thumbs up!


Yes, of course. We did what we had to do. We improvised. Like Fjord told me the other day: you have to improvise. This stone has a twin somewhere and we can talk with it. I don’t know who it is. Honestly, my opinion is, the probability of someone trying to find us, searching for this thing, is like looking for a needle in a haystack in a newly made warzone. However, in the meantime, I was wondering if you’d hold it inside of your fancy bag, because--


The fuck?! I still run.


Yeah, but it doesn't matter because she's got the Dawnmartyr.


Immediately? You need to get on a boat?


That's 8d6.


If you're going to do it, have a light source.


I want to perception check for traps and for Thieves' Cant and anything else.


Ooh! Oh, nice. I will sing to him, let's see if I can do this. "Come on, come on, get your Scanlan on, it's Thursday night and it won't be long, gonna play my flute, play my shawm, it's Thursday night and it won't be long 'til I get your health up, get your health up, I got all you need, no I don't shoot bows, I don't swing swords, but damn I can sing." (All cheer.)


We're really tough. We have no fear.
