Get it girl. Get it.


We'll find out as soon as we get there.


Got you. Standard gear.


We can take someone on a broom.


Don't make me talk to him, because it won't go well.


Is it pee-colored?


A new prescription!


Thank you, Jester.


If you box it in, we can't get inside.


(French accent) If you please, and with due respect, I do not see any jewelry or fineries on your person. Can you afford such prices that I will quote you?


That won't be necessary for me but for the rest of you.


I would let him know! I would give him like a disclaimer.


Yeah, like five.


It's the only time that seems to matter.


It could be a diamond shipment.


Jarett! Are you up for it?


She's got wings that are so magical.


Frumpkin disappears from on Nott's shoulder. Reappears next to the little man.


-- in our house. And he was just a little prick.


I'll take the horn.


I'm sorry, I just saw a flash of my future.


What did you find? Oh. (whispering) What did you find?


Oh. Don't fall for it, Trinket!


She's Allura's friend, right?


Stealthily?


Is that a, is that a--


I want to put one on.


Oh, I thought Sutan was a title, like Lord Lord Lord.


It's so adorable! Oh, he's watching right now and I just called him adorable. I feel so bad.


I think I've learned their first names at least.


This is for me?


Dedicated to Vecna.


But how will we leave something from the High-Richter if I don't know actually what her handwriting looks like yet?


Oh, there is?


"Pudding."


Travis is shouting.


Oh. Me neither.


What's our visibility like? 40, 60?


We'll see what we can do.


Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you!


King of improv. Right here.


You told me, when I pick-pocketed that guy topside, it was a healing potion. It was blue, right? That's what you told me.


Oh no, not south. (laughter)


Okay, I'm gonna keep coming this way, stealthing.


That's true, park the cart next to the fire.


I think I've met weirder people.


Do you want to chase it?


Here, you said?


Good luck today.


We're also not alone here. Allura, how does this sit with you?


I totally forgot. I'm so sorry. I'm at 26. I got distracted because I have a new--


I feel a little exposed.


I'm going to try and cast some more ammunition, since I'm out.


We have to be ready to fight. Grab it and then Jenga out.


Are they closing in on Pike?


Of course she can.


It could also potentially be bullshit.


No. I stay with my dice.


I cast Watery Sphere at the end of the last guy and create a giant ball.


Well, multiple things. There's just go back to Kraghammer and get money, or go where Keyleth wants to go.


Mountain ranges are part of my favored terrain. We don't get disadvantage traveling through.


I'll also join in for one more for that as well. It's my last spell slot.


We are level four. Eight damage, sick.


Your daughter's in Kymal?


It all matters!


Ooh! We both get it.


Vestige.


(laughs) Yeah, but see, I'm the guest. Where it matters is just getting some revenge. So he is still--


Oh, good. (laughs) I was thinking 22 points of damage!


Okay. I look at Yasha and I'll go down first. Right after me. Okay, ready? I'm going to aim right for his other eye socket, the other one that Nott hit, and come down right in the middle, try and gore his head out.


He smells?


Feels like it matters.


This sucks, you guys!


It's actually a little discomforting, these symbols.


I like that one. 31.


Yeah, hang on, got to think about this.


It's a single attack.


Before we go down the fountain, I'm going to walk past Jamedi again.


Okay. I'm just going to go, (yells) and run into the fire.


Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave, or does it look made?


I am!


I don't know, you're pretty heavy. You might fit--


Are there trees nearby?


You guys, come up here. There's a ton of arms up here. There's battleaxes and swords, but there's all these trinkets and holy symbols.


Before we knock, what were we told was in this thing?


What are you, Switzerland? C'mon.


Six seconds. Yes! You can reply to this message!


No. I stay.


Including the Beatles.


As far as it goes, yeah.


Blue, like your feather.


The good bell, not the bad bell.


It's a gamble.


This makes me feel so uncomfortable.


(screaming) I'm hurting! You can reply to this message!


Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.


How are you fitting in?


Physical thing.


(yells) (all laugh)


On the left side of the keep.


Yeah, they're official licensed TableTop merchandise that we made happen. I'm very happy.


He also takes 15 points of piercing damage.


To the duck?


"This time of year," like it happens every year?


It's okay. He always gets his squires to do his dirty work. But we have the seal.


I did already.


No, that I'm back and I'm dedicated. I figured showing up would be good, you know?


I will join Beau, just in case someone decides to fuck around.


I know, I'm going to cast-- I'm going to cure you.


I still want that question answered, but he can go ahead.


I'm going to do that! I'm going to dash.


12. Plus nothing, Taliesin.


Boots!?


More than that, isn't it?


I'm old!


(eager laugh)


You'll just have to live. You wait and find out.


Or who does he report to?


Let me take care of it. I'll pour everyone a glass.


I know, they're like frozen though, right? Don't they get frozen with Sleet Storm?


You're welcome, I'm sorry it's kind of a weak thing, though.


Hass or Ikithon?


Any other details that you've been holding back that would help us in this situation.


You mean physically or mentally? Because I'm in love with you. (laughter)


I just want to sit outside still.


Find out what they've learned.


It was on top of a head. Ugh, that's really gross.


Porn.


It's not very high. Oh, no, yes it is. It's a 20.


Sorry, I want to bring this with me that's all.


I mean, it feels like this stuff is always at the bottom or at the end.


Frumpkin will run forward out of the darkness.


1d8 plus three. Right?


You said slavers?


We offer you redemption. Collaborating with us grants you the power to fell a would-be god.


Can I use the rest of my movement to get back up on the broom? And go up in the air?


You're great, though.


We don't have to distract him, he said it's all for the taking.


It's kind of there (groans).


Flash Gordon.


Yep. That's what this game is about now, Travis.


I can make that work.


No, it was terrible. Everything looked the same. It was dark, it was gray, it was full of fucking nightmares.


Maybe the lava is a secret passage! Grog, you should swim down and find out!


18. Sorry.


(laughter) Whoosh! (imitates dramatic music)


Half damage? Wait, what? No damage!


Do that. Yeah? I can go swimming.


Isn't Allura on her way here? Aren't a lot of people on their way here? I'm so confused.


Like a jackrabbit.


Yeah. She's fine.


Yeah, you're right, you're right.


Backblaze!


We have several pounds.


I'm going to cast Enhance Ability and give him Cat's Grace for his dexterity checks.


Crownsguard Alexander. So formal.


Aw! I miss Percy.


We all have our actions, so hold your attack 'cause I'll pull Fjord away.


Loot Crate, Loot Crate.


Wasn't it weird?


Because I don't see anything. (laughter)


(vomiting noises) Would you like some?


Yeah, they don't want them to come back.


(heavy footsteps)


(impressed whistling)


And I'm going to do it back behind camp, on the treeline or whatever.


They're pretty cool.


Way better than last time.


The tunnel on top?


I think you didn't use anything.


It's plus three is my spellcasting modifier.


Take one last deep breath. Going to drop down and going to use that-- nope, the rope is attached to me. Going to drop down and see if I can go for Jester.


Learning names.


I assumed that it would carry over, but you're right. It drops and you start afresh.


Sondur.


Dude, you just swallowed that thing whole. Like totally.


I grab Keyleth and we slip behind them and into the kitchen.


I'm going to stand by your side as you pay her.


Oh god, yeah.


Left and right.


I see you're skinning the beast. Can I ask why?


Can I also cast Beacon of Hope on her?


That's seven points of damage.


What was it?!


No, I said I didn't have anything to hold up!


Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I could do-- attempt something similar. Potentially with a higher-level version of my Locate Creature spell--


Oh, Garmelie!


Nonlethal.


Kevdak's son.


A deception check. Okay.


Breathe in, breathe out.


Doty, don't do that.


Okay okay okay.


Yeah. Do you have a name?


Kit, we love you.


Life is not a book!


No, we can just send him up there, and then we can head in through the tower. He can just be a problem.


I've seen it coming for a long time.


Can I attempt to hide?


When I see the salamander take out the big, shiny sharp thing, I go into a rage.


Aye, and I do. If I wanted to find this Earthbreaker Groom--


Out the house, like get out?


Fuck that. We're all going down. I take the Titanstone Knuckles and I smash them together, and I use the Enlarge, and I will burst out of the mansion in a rage.


What do you think about the empire? About the crown?


And I'm going to attack him twice! Because I'm original.


So, 10, plus sneak attack damage, right?


I crawled out through an arrow hole.


Fabulous. Our friend, Keyleth, is amazing.


Can I get a sense on when this was carved? If this was carved recently or if this has been here a while?


You'll be fine!


Yeah. Feelid. Bryce Feelid. Watchmaster Bryce Feelid. Elf. Leader of the guard. Very sweet person. These are all the things I wrote down.


We don't know. We just got here.


I'm going to step into it.


Make it good.


No whales, no narwhals.


Okay, I'm going to cast Call Lightning. And I'm going to bring down a bolt. Here we go. This way. Right in between Sir Kerrion and this guard so they both have to save from it.


That was fun, I have to admit.


Do you understand?


I found poison oak, you guys!


That's multiple.


Over-exaggerated nod.


Cubby-holes. Up high for anyone who can take to the air, down low for anyone who can't.


Call me pinball wizard.


We got to go. 35 to 40 people? Let's kill 'em all on the way up.


Wait! I thought she was just a common guard!


That's true, I can do it all.


I'm sorry, the magic one is six points plus three ice, so nine points.


Yeah, but it's still big.


I don't know how we would use it.


So now when it looks down at us, does it change the direction of the cone?


Yeah, are they well? In one piece?


She just walked out.


Oh yeah! I've got lots of shit. We have a salt lick rock, we've got three firewood bundles, dried food rations...


You want to go to sleep in this undead city?!


I'll take one more shot at him.


It's a javelin. It's beautiful.


Should we go recon on the auction as slave shopping or whatever it is?


We do. I was-- I feel like I've been negligent. That we've not been--


16 hits?


(whispering) What? What's going on? Nott! Shit!


All right, Percival.


Whenever you're ready.


What are you afraid of? What do you think she's gonna ask of you?


I had to go get Velora. She fucking fell.


Do I have more things? Can I rush forward and try the second door?


Right on-- right, yeah. There you go.


That's five of them now?


I'm going to turn invisible.


We're going to walk with a celestial in the middle of the streets?


I will throw something.


That and many other things, yes. Have you ever seen a goblin before?


What would you say?


Just a little bit, but only completely. Tiberius--


The biscuit was very filling. It was extremely filling.


Wait, we're in the spiral staircase and it goes--


And claim it as my own!


We're not going to set him on fire.


He's had more than one.


Yeah, I'll do it.


What do you say we go get you a new bow?


No, it's just a tree now, I think it's okay.


She healed up drunk.


I thought you said advantage.


Oh, he's my lawyer.


At least Trinket's behind me.


DM, who is this person who's just joined us? For the audience.


Can I see him? Can I go ahead and cast Hunter's Mark on him right now?


We are doing shifts, right?


And how are we going to get this creature there?


Did we tell them to go fishing?


Like I just told you.


The ground is cursed.


Who has the coughs? How do we know?


I think am, let's see if I wrote it down here. Oh, yeah! I forgot! I'm almost dead.


Is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door? Anything other than a portal to go through?


Can I try to intimidate him with my extra bonus attack and tell him to drop his weapon?


I'm desperately trying to commit every direction to memory.


Yeah. That'll be a 28. I run up behind Grog, and I should be within--


Found a necklace, who was supposed to go-- hang on, I'm finding it, I'm looking.


Three, two. Grog smashes.


I'd like to take a step back, put my back foot on the wall, and then push off into the air with a huge overhand right.


That's 29. Sorry. It's a lot.


Yeah, I have to be.


Sorry about the hand gesture there, stop it. (all laugh)


27, 33, 36... So 76!


(whispers) And you have to get naked.


(screeches)


How long have you known this one?


We are the best planners. Ever.


Okay. And then I move forward so I can see him. Right there. All right. And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him! And then I'm going to shoot my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel at him. So that, I'm going to shoot an arrow and it divides into three arrows and they all turn into storm arrows. So I roll an attack for each one of those for my first attack.


Yeah. Can I make a quick look down? Do I see any Spire of Conflux?


I'm not sure what he did though. Pantsing?


No, they eloped, so we're clear.


He was really talented, though. I mean, like, super duper.


Bowl that Fireball, dude!


It sunders the tower?


Yannick. Jan?


41.


Trinket runs forward and tries to pull Grog's focus so that I can back away.


Yeah, I'm going to step back.


(rasping) Next time I'm going to really hurt you! I said that in Infernal.


We don't walk away.


It's in. Is it in?


He's got pink hair; he's really pretty.


Stealth check?


We got this.


Not bad. 19.


Okay, we're going to find Kern.


Queen... pillar? Queen's--


Expeditious Retreat! As a reaction.


I think it's safe to say, even in retrospect.


What's the Celestial word for time?


So that's 15 plus-- that's 23 points of damage plus three points of fire damage.


No, the good gun. In the-- what's that Martin Lawrence movie? Bad Boys. They did it all in slow motion. Just throw the gun. Okay. As a bonus action, I will Healing Word Pike.


We'll fan out in a wide line as we approach instead of as a group.


Good musical riff.


Oh my gosh, that's so pretty!


Give him time.


The chagrin?


Oh yeah, a "'stow' of our mountain secrets."


But with advantage.


MVP'ed it.


Oh, going the wrong way.


(whispers) Ask her name! (laughter)


What if she gets mad?


Trinket's mother. Bless you. Is Scanlan in the room?


Do I look like The Gentleman right now?


That's damage.


My first nemesis!


Am I within melee of that skeleton dragon? The bone dragon?


Sextuplets!


Wasn't expecting the ashes part.


The two humans. Are they traveling together?


Plus a d4 is--


(singing) And naked!


Burn the mine to the ground? Under the ground?


But look how cute she is.


But when we got to the middle, we found a big giant pyramid. Or a ziggy-star-- what?


Okay, that is eight.


You're not dead!


Yeah, couple layers, right?


Just go for it. I'm a fan of one-dollar bills.


Fuck. You.


There goes our IHOP sponsorship.


I did not. You were in charge.


Are we taking a rest? I don't know how many--


It's a one!


Don't think it's going to help.


Thank you for the warning.


He went to Jared!


Keep that in mind. (laughter)


It is almost like a drunken CrossFit gym. I'm sorry. It is almost like a CrossFit gym.


Wait, what did you ask?


I'm just going to do it.


Then he takes off his helmet this time, and you see that he's got the most fabulous hair that blows in the wind.


Well, you could've just asked.


Okay, first one  17?


I'm just going to gently open the door and peek inside and see if anybody's inside.


Ah. Ah!


No you're not!


Who all can make disguises for themselves?


(whispers) You're going to have a very good morning. Good night.


Is there any guards around or are they mostly gone because of the celebration?


Oh no. We'll get you another drink.


That's straight-up Goonies. This place has been pilfered before and no one took that.


I'm a nine.


Yeah, do you know? Blink once for yes, blink twice for no.


I feel great right now, by the way.


Oh no! So if you could send an order of sliders--


Cordell. Cordell! What is this tent?


That's when we fought the Nightmare.


Can he grab her and climb?


I take her by the head and I rustle our heads together.


DM will fill that information in.


I take the satchel, and I give it to Pike and say: look in here.


I was distracted.


It occurs to me that starting tomorrow, it would be more important than ever that we stick together.


You don't like the trust exercise?


Drop off.


Oh! That's fun!


Yeah, maybe not a good idea to walk over there.


Wait, don't you get an advant-- no.


Oh, Matt's back!


Two.


Did I finish killing my gem?


And we got drugs on top of it. It was a win-win, am I right?


All right. Turn's up.


We see him all the time. A fixture in the night sky.


(rock voice) Knock-knock. (normal voice) First attack is 13 plus-- 18 points. Second, not as good, ten points.


They're up? They're below us?


Insight check! [laughter] 11 plus, what am I adding? 13.


Stay close.


You know, I think I have some more libations in me.


(strained) Buy it.


Isn't it interesting that we all feel the need to convince her, no matter what? I'm just pointing that out.


But we should adjust it, right? If they're looking for Jester, why don't we put in a little doubt, right? They're looking for a blue-skinned tiefling. Why don't we just say: Oh, I heard it was a green-skinned dwarf, or something like that. Just do a little confusion so maybe they're not sure who it was, who killed herself on the dock. I heard she was already crazy, or something like that. And then maybe the ship that was taken. Didn't it have that distinct three-mast silhouette that you would definitely recognize?


Perception? Is that what you said?


Yeah. It's just a heat sink.


Be quiet, we're being followed.


Oh, terrible. Five points.


Plus ten, because Pass Without a Trace.


We'll see what kind of plan we can come up with. We have a day.


Minus a d4.


Nice! That's so cool.


Is the big tree eating you all?


Scroll down, there's a button.


I want to kill it.


But you still get advantage because you flanked!


Oh, it's getting so late.


I use Beast Speech. Are you all right? Are you all right, Trinket? Everything okay? I can speak to him.


What should we be looking for?


Oglen Hornsblower.


I should have to roll, yeah?


What did he look like?


I've got this, guys. We're connected in a special gnome way that you have no idea how pure this bond is.


Trinket, with me, if you wouldn't mind. And we're going to walk up to the altar and push the sarcophagus open.


Atlas Obscura the hell out of the City of Dis.


Radiant damage is what we need in here.


Oh pish posh.


It's all that ale, Grog.


Love you, Sam!


But it seemed like you were about to discuss-- you've seen his pattern in the city, where he goes day to day?


Oh, we're gonna walk by the tree?


Is there anybody who is not made uncomfortable by this?


Is there a bell or anything?


Dry running it.


Okay, then for my bonus action-- I get a bonus action?


To support GameChanger, to learn more about what we do, you can visit www.gamechangercharity.org, and if you go to our website, you can see our campaign with Deus Ex. You can go online and if you donate anything more than a dollar, you get a free copy, a director's cut--


Okay, I’m going to roll towards that corner as well.


How many dragons have you come across, sir? Are you interested in dragon parts?


Magic can't put me to sleep.


Oh god, no, not my stuff. That'd be ridiculous. My stuff's worthless.


No! And I go into a frenzied rage. If it's gonna be an ass-beating we take, we might as well just get on with it. And I'll use reckless attack and Great Weapon Master against him.


Insight check on that statement.


So it's Grog's herd or the sphinx to get something.


How fortunate.


Your magical cup that makes liquids.


Ten feet out the window and he's 150 and I'm-- my shot is what, but with Sharpshooter-- no, that's different.


Just start collapsing it.


I think there might be a lot of giants potentially in here at any one time.


Oh yes, here it is. Come on, charis.


Fucked up! You managed in the space of a week to make the choke-out seem like child's play!


Yeah. Just so. I'll turn and walk off.


(sputtering, laughing)


What? What does it say?


We're in a room.


Taking the piss.


Did he come out? I thought he came out.


D&D Beyond, what a year of sponsorship from D&D Beyond! They've been with us all campaign long, all year long, and to thank them for such a wonderful 2018, I thought I would give them a gift, an ad that will hopefully live on forever. I'm calling it My Christmas Gif. You heard that right. It's not a Christmas gift, it's a Christmas GIF.


He's so lively all of a sudden.


I don't think he can understand you, Grog.


Right now. In the morning?


Legitimately, no one can tell when I'm lying.


You can have Fjord's ring. Fjord doesn't want one, right?


(Scottish accent) I love it!


Of Hallucinatory Terrain?


Fine. I'm going to take another headshot. Burning my grit.


A soft 10 30.


I'm crouching!


No! Fucking--


All right. Well, then you guys got this well in hand. I'm going to fly to the other guy. Is he going to get an attack on me?


I have a few questions. Is that all right?


It should still be able to work, yeah, theoretically.


Judging by the map, how far are we from any town?


Fingers crossed. Let's not do that to Keyleth.


Thank god for that lump of Quall.


The guards have generally been alerted to be wary, kind, polite, and less important that they stop them from doing anything too terrible, more to the point that they just write it down and report it immediately. (laughter)


It landed three. It got five attacks.


Wait, do let it stop me, or don't?


What the fuck is that? That's a thing you made up.


(laughs) That's true, that is all you heard.


Just kidding. It's in Westruun.


Initiative!


I drop them off at the beach.


But! She has your copper pieces!


Before we started rolling, this paint smells like farts. But only when it's painted on a human face. (laughter)


I think we all would have been dead back there had you not made your offer, which you didn't have to do. It's noted.


Maybe they can work with us.


That's all. Be pleased. We will see you in a couple of days.


I thought we dropped Seeming, though?


So polite.


Yeah, you should read our notes. We have liner notes.


I'm going to go into the room and find the nice creature that we left there.


I'm not going to play. I'm just gonna look at these.


Feet skidding, like a Jackie Chan film.


What's that? What does that do?


That is an 18.


Rick.


Do we have two Channel Divinities or just one at this level? Then I Turn Undead!


That's bananas. You should be able to look at the sun and say, "oh, six."


Okay, well that's good to know.


What's that hashtag again?


While she does this, I come over the earpiece and I say, Grog, Percy, quick, get back up to the central tower. Quick.


Time out, time out, time out.


With an inspirational quote.


Seven days, ten minutes.


Immediately.


It's just a door, you guys! It's just a door.


Wow. Well, there you go.


Peanut butter and jelly.


Yes, it should prove to be quite educational, I would think.


Okay, yeah. Yeah.


I'm just going to roll the other one, too. And that's a 30, that hits. So that's, plus 12. Eight, 15, 25. That's 27 points of damage.


Mm-hm. I have a very bad feeling about these suits of armor.


I know. Because of the lava.


Now you have 3 hit points. Come on, Grog. Don't die. Again.


I wasn't.


Oh god. One two three, not it!


You need to remove--


17. (pause) No, you guys have it.


You're all glisteny!


I'm going to Detect Magic to get a--


You never know. Maybe somebody else has already done what you did and they already pooped it out, and now it's in you.


My perception was off.


Well, my question is, is this a temple? If it is a temple to Kord, is this a place of battle? Is this somewhere where people go watch battles and fighting?


We can only be so hopeful.


You're invisible!


I'm going to go ahead and wait until the 15-minute mark-- no, I'm going to wait until the ten-minute mark and then Enhance Ability on Scanlan.


Yeah, but I didn't talk as animals. I wasn't talking.


I wonder how the contract works? I bet it's like a magical contract or something like that where you sign it and then they have like your soul!


I don't know what to do.


Yes. I go run and jump on Grog's shoulders.


Can anyone create a distraction that doesn't put their own person at risk?


I don't care who started or finished it. Obviously, we will pay for the damages out of your troupe's pocket.


Oh shit. I'm getting real tired, you guys-- Oh, I'm not. I'm not getting tired at all, actually. 17.


I'm going to walk up right up next to Keyleth in front of the bear. One, can I go diagonally?


What's an AOE?


Where does he hail from?


So. (counting) Ten plus four, 14.


Deep in the single digits.


Sure, we have an extra 50 feet, we didn't really need the rest.


You should be important!


Such a bore.


You want to arm wrestle?


Please hurry.


You know, it's funny, he left feeling like we didn't appreciate his worth, and these last few weeks have really made me understand how much I did. I think he hit on a lot of really good points when he left us. I don't forgive him for them just yet, but I'm trying not to hate him for it.


Thank you, tie it up tight. I'm going to go down to the, what is it, the temple below the thingie?


You're so strong, Pike.


(gasps) We should just go down.


Did we ever talk to Cassandra or anyone else about starting an alarm system here?


That is racist!


And they are the rival family of the folks that employ the Iron Shepherds.


Thank you! Right? It's all about the commentary that happens, right? If we hit that goal we will do that. Details and to donate, you can see everything at critrole.com/osd.


That was a really good roll.


Did the blue gemstones look valuable?


Oh! As I'm running by because the coffee's hot. Hot. Oh, excuse me, would you happen to have any particular dragonites for sale? Male, preferably, but I will take female if you have one. (quietly) I'm just making it hotter when I blow on it.


We tried that. We've tried that. I mean, maybe it'll work. We just run willy-nilly. That's what we do.


Do you know much about the Nine Hells?


I can try-- I can certainly try! [cheering]


Well, he can't see where we're going, right?


You just got carried by an invisible bear!


Grog is on god mode.


It was the best thing you never heard. (laughter)


He knows that I don't trust them.


Who? Oh, the wife?


Does that put me within 30 feet of that croc?


You would think.


You're going to get yours. It's coming. And I'm going to help you. And I'm going to high five you when it's done. But until then, you keep that shit tucked inside. Let it build. And then when the time is right, you let her have it. And I'll throw you into the fray, when the time is right.


I can't anymore.


Are we all there?


Yeah, we might hop around.


Yeah, we haven't been here--


How fast does this cloud thing move?


I'm awake enough.


Okay, so it's half this?


I think we should name him--


How hard can it be to steal 2,000 gold?


I don't like her.


It would be rope on the ground. I don't know if it would hide in that.


Do whatever you want. It's awesome.


Vax'ildan.


It seemed human-ish.


Do I understand what's happening, with why they're going back to the pots, to whatever's in the pots?


We did, yes. I kept a memento. I hold up the longsword.


He should've got the message immediately. I'm pretty sure he's researching it before he answers.


No, he can't see you.


What story is that?


Gate of the leviathan?


Does it look like people are avoiding us or does it look like this is not a place of--


It's along the way.


I need my thing? Where's the currency in here?


Please don't fuck up on a sleeping guy. 14 and 15.


If we fail, he could be coming after them. They have no line of defense.


Meatstick?


I crack my knuckles behind Fjord.


And so--


Put them in the bag of holding, Grog.


We also have 15 cases of expensive-ass bottles of wine.


Is that wrong of me?


Is Stinking Cloud methane-based?


Guys, so far, Storks is just eking out 50 Shades of Grey and Nails & Screws. It's tight now. It's 32%, 32% and 36%.


Yeah. I walk Nott over to the western wall. What is it?


And then I say, dear god, please, Taryon, find the other lodestone. Don't kill the kraken!


Just need a two.


Oh shit! Grog! Open the door! Dust of Tracelessness! Out the door! Right now!


Seemed nice.


Intimidation, you said, or persuasion?


Is there a door?


Can I insight check him on 'I have nothing'?


I try to make it look like we weren't around this area as much as possible without our Dust of Tracelessness.


All right, fine. Can we make things look fancy around here so when they all come back, we look like we're ready to talk to them?


And now he has disadvantage on his attacks for the next round.


I genuinely don't know how to say no to tea.


Fluffernutter would have totally obliterated it. We wouldn't have even had to fight.


Sorry, that went a little bit longer than I thought.


That's probably not kept well.


I think that was the most stressful game I've ever played.


We were at the Ren Faire, to be fair.


How do fire giants feel about the name, the Suutan-- Oh, wait. I already asked him that. Never mind. You know what, been a huge help. (laughter)


Thank you. Vax. Was this yours?


You dip your ammunition in it.


It doesn't have to move to do it, does it?


Not for this. I should just be gone a couple of hours.


What I don't like about this is that the asshole was sleeping upstairs and we don't know about that at all, but I send Frumpkin along the ceiling and through-- that looks like a barred gate.


Or broken toes, if you will.


It's One Direction.


Sure he does.


Woo.


Maybe I could do the Fire Bolt from afar. That's a good idea, and a leader idea that I had that you just reminded me of.


That's a 20 to hit?


Guest of honor for the night. He’s a comedian.


I believe so. I'm double-checking. I can do Hidden Step as a bonus action.


Am I close enough to get out of the boat?


No chicken.


4d8?


What is this witchcraft? (laughter)


Okay. I'm still going to go get Grog, but I'll pass the scroll around. Hey Grog, come upstairs.


Maybe they were gathering a bunch of these items because they were looking for the exact one for this one.


Slower.


So exactly the same as the guy, except long hair.


I carved my name into the floor.


I want to send a message to her before we go to sleep tonight.


You're active? Stay active.


It's just on me?


You had eight.


Where did you get these items?


It's a d6 cut in half.


That would be one powerful fucking spell.


Stomp all over the brain to get to it.


You can grow a beard?


It touched the ground, that means it's cursed now.


Only because I turn around at Scanlan and go: (laughs) That's good. Aw, yeah.


Let me find it on my--


It thinks I'm a four-foot tall Halas.


(distressed noises)


And Keyleth goes-- ASHLEY If she looks over at me, I'm going--


That hits me, motherfucker.


(growls) Bite. No. Son of a cock.


I shout to Percy, come, Tiberius, now!


The sticks! The dynamite sticks!


Yeah, Percy, get your rest, because your last words to me tomorrow need to be indignant and irritated.


We have come from very far to take a look--


One assumes there's a mist that's just covering everything--


Are we calling dibs on the boat?


It's just-- there's a lot of holiness here. (laughter)


The minute I hear things start, I'm going to cast some light on the walls so I can see shit.


You turned him into a stain.


Oh, Yasha.


It's okay, we can still kill everybody.


You say yes.


You do what you want.


Really? But it's so cool inside, why don't people want to come see you?


I'm good in my head.


And-- Oh no. And your, my, our beloved Dungeon Master; give it up for Matthew Mercer! [cheering]


Performance. Oh no, performance!


We're in a safe place.


Disadvantage. Grit or no grit?


You're going to pull through, buddy.


That is a good thing.


Why would you feel any pressure that way?


But he was on first watch.


19 points.


There's too many options!


But, just in case, I think I'll hang back. I'm not going down to the pre-made tunnel, I'll just keep an eye above ground.


That's two in there, right?


She's just out because of the effect of the--


Okay, 18 to hit.


Not great. Oh! I get advantage on wisdom, right?


No, no, it's all you. It's all you.


Hey, wait a second here, Vax. That was an enforcer. He kept the people oppressed. He worked for the Briarwoods and punished all of these farmers for not bringing enough taxes and enough tithes.


Thanks, Stubbs. You're way more powerful than I am, and I don't know what I'm going to-- (Skype noise)


Am I within five feet of Scanlan?


(sighing) Yeah...


I hope your stupid plan works!


Is everything copacetic between the different tribes?


I just think we should make headway if we're going to be traveling all day. Grog, do you even have any weapons anymore?


In town?


Are those Cheez-Its you're eating right there?


I'll use the dagger to hit. Am I at disadvantage with the dagger still?


Hey, that's the best thing ever!


East?


I have advantage because of gnome cunning?


Yes, I did see it.


I go with Percy, since we have the robes over top of us.


Kid's dead, let's go home.


Yeah. Well, I wonder, I mean, I wonder if anyone else-- I think, is our time up, or--?


No. It was my negligence in proper planning that added to this.


Roomies!


I think I want to go underneath the gap.


In the meantime, check out those Critical Role keychains available on Geek and Sundry. (laughter)


Let's get a round of von Brandt for everybody.


They're fine. You're fine. You're level 16, motherfuckers. You're fine.


Correct. Okay.


All right. Acrobatics. Yeah, that's fine.


I start brushing his hair off of his face.


Are you trying it?


Who put this one together?


Let me break the traps first.


Then I'm going to punch each one of them again.


They may not give them to us unless he's there.


We're sitting and hookah-ing through this whole fucking thing.


We'll get through doors, set the node, set everything we need into action.


Hey, Jester?


Planted one what? Like a tree?


(straining)


We'll plug our other friends who are also nominated.


Yep. Stoneblack says it's all right.


I just got it! I'm going to use it!


Oh, I warn them there's owlbears in the area before I go to sleep.


(raspy) I have your power.


I'm going into the kitchen with the Titanstone Knuckles, and I'm gonna start hitting things.


I take it.


I grab the stump and I pick him up into the air.


I think he's talking to the cat.


You can spend days on a ship.


Oh fuck, yeah, that's right.


You're so cool.


You should really control the people in this city from talking about that, because it's weird.


We're making assholes of ourselves.


Tracks in a tunnel.


I want to stay the same height, but if for some reason I fell, there would be land. And then as a bonus action, I'm going to take a superior healing potion that I have. And that will be my turn.


Meanwhile, one hour later.


-- beautiful salesman, carrier of all delightful things.


Five feet.


Just to meet with her?


Ooh, oh no.


I'm a crime lord. I can get you really good discount furniture.


Anyway, I would love to ask Bertholt if he knows the location of my sister.


Dash, everything.


Detect Magic!


I'm not in trouble for anything. I think, if anything, it would be because of the god I've chosen to follow.


So petty.


Bow up!


I'm growling! Arrr!


What's he looking up?


Ah, fuck, whales are fucking big, though!


And write comment cards.


You are not going to go pass out in the street. You told me to be in charge of this. I walk him upstairs and makes sure he gets in bed.


Yep, okay. Travis?


(southern accent) I was thinking oversized handcuffs, but nevermind.


Do you propel yourself with thoughts?


So is there a location to go to the ocean?


Like your life reset somehow? Or you just don't remember?


I forgot there was an insect cloud.


I don't think-- I don't know.


She had a tail.


Yes, he's a disguised robot.


Kobayashi Maru, you got this.


Okay, I'm going to double ba-- Ah, I can't move anymore, can I?


I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows like this!


Wait, wait, wait! We just need to return--


(squeals)


Do we need some sort of-- anything for you to cast the spell?


It's the same spell.


Can Grog lift it okay, I guess? He's probably the only one.


Yeah. I feel pretty good. I like this plan.


That got us in a lot of trouble.


Do you know how to do that?


For fuck's sake. Nope. That was a ten.


There's nothing you can't ruin.


Does he have a spear? I thought he had a bow. Oh, he's got both.


He's a very stern dad.


We've got your back, Keyleth.


I understand you, Clarota, and I'm on your side. I swear. But a lot of people-- there have been a lot of murderers who said they did the things that they did because their gods told them to do it. Right?


Yeah. She's fine. (laughter)


And now, Wall Of Stone.


I'm going for a walk.


Do you want to have it for the night?


And would become what?


Five!


BDE.


Ooh, night walk?


How long have you been having visions, in terms of this happening with me?


Can we just automatically get a short rest, just because that was the most--


Not intentional. Skags.


Shall we go back to our keep?


Thank you. I also said  He has a shield and a scimitar. I don't know if we can get the shield away from him, but it'll make him easier to hit.


Oh, well, that's disconcerting.


Tell you what. I'll give you-- none of it back, I can't! Okay, here's one silver back--


I'm going to keep pushing along--


Yeah. I mean, we need a blanket as well.


Where is your dad from?


Like, you go to church and then we go to the casino?


Yeah, the darkest corner.


I'm going to NPC my ass right across the street.


Can he float?


Okay. That's 24. 21.


With disadvantage.


--stay away from my bird.


Strength check, 19 plus two.


And I hop off the carpet and I leave it there.


"I invoke the second pact!"


Or are you trying to get us to the lake? I'm so confused. This is out of character, I literally don't have an idea what's going on.


Come on. Ah, better. 20.


We had to have 100 gold, didn't we?


Do you spice?!


I just got whacked.


Pelor lives here.


Yeah, rap-battle.


That's all right. That might be a little bit too out there, so--


It's a Scorching Ray spell. A little plus five.


So what do we do?


I'm just going to help with the spines of books at this point.


Seven's a good start. (laughter)


I know, it's ridiculous. 16-- 16-- 19, and then an additional d10. So 19 of fire damage. So 25 for the third.


There are some tree saps, when left for a long time, they have a funny taste to them. Sometimes I taste that, but--


Is that the finger? Or is that the finger?


It looks like a ferengi from Star Trek.


(quietly) Oh, shitfuck. (louder) That's okay. That's okay!


We're going to be doing this live next time?


Wence, thank you so much. Could I grab another of those fabulous five-gold drinks there, that you brought to our friend?


She misspoke. I'm so sorry. She completely misspoke.


Can you also take your bonus action to run too?


That's the fury of the small.


You need a minute?


I step into the room.


It does it again?! It didn't expend?!


I think Grog is smitten!


Mm-hm. That's true.


And I see if I can manifest the cold?


There's no crawl space access? No attic I can get to?


No way! What? No! I want to keep playing.


(southern drawl) I apologize.


Yeah, you up for it?


24 hours. So we can still take a long rest and still have benefits from the feast. It lasts for 24 hours.


That's a lot of dice he's picking up.


I've gotta give you something kind of real. Kind of beastly. But it is challenge rating four or lower, which is awesome. That's cool.


Merkin Dullbringer.


Never mind, I didn't say it, I didn't say it so it doesn't matter.


Have a drink, see the local color?


Okay. That's my action.


Don't say those things, Marisha.


She's very upset about the whole Scanlan thing.


They've imprisoned the people. We can't talk to each other.


Inspiration!


Yeah, we can roll some hit dice.


It looks like a target. Whisper.


The bear will probably be able to come with us. Sorry.


Scones are hard to make.


Can we repair after that?


I spit in his face.


And she added that.


This is your thing, you are strong!


You have to roll a ten!


That's not the cup of a carpenter.


Announcements continue!


I'm a little confused. We're going underwater now, but not to where we're going for the mission?


So mostly grey.


I start working on the robe.


What is Pike riding on?


Well, let's be real. She's the coolest one in the group, really.


You remember how to play?


Probably like 15 gold then for just that amount.


Shorthalt's back.


I did. I gave you ten.


Cabin boy, thank you.


Can Pike follow us around all the time everywhere for the rest of our days?


I never understood that penny.


Okay. I look around really fast, run up to my sister, give her a giant hug, and (magic sound) Dimension Door over to where Grog is.


See? This is what I'm telling you.


He might have burned it.


I want to see if they're just camping out around us or if they're going away.


Yeah, you did. Okay.


Has all our blood.


It says it was written by Matilda Merceria!


But there's lava spilling and we can see in dim light.


Check them out at Pax Unplugged this weekend.


Damn! All right. Are you still hurting, Grog? As my bonus action, I'm going to give Grog some more healing.


Then I make two greater healing potions. Actually, no, I want to experiment. I want to take one of those holy water bottles. And I want to see if I can enchant it with my Fog spell. To make it a holy water fog grenade. When you throw it, it'll go (shatters) with my fog spell.


Yeah, I'm frozen.


You know I think maybe you are confusing my good friend and I. You know, she's very little, and I am taller. So, it does have that sort of father-daughter look, but you know well, that's not exactly what it is.


Love the hat.


Apparently. (laughter)


She's changing. Crying, naked.


Oh, yeah! You're made of jelly. Can you do it?


Of course we can track it.


Why is this on me, guys?! Two.


Not great. Seven points of damage.


Hey, well, you know, we don't get a lot of time to talk alone because everything is so fucked up, but you seemed really on-edge. More than normal, when we lived there before. You know what I'm talking about.


Still 15.


Like healing? Like you want me to use a whole spell on this teensy-ass wuss cut?


No no no! Don't-- Grog!


Okay. Wait-- Oh, you mean. With your cube.


Oh, I don't believe it.


I could drag it behind me for a little bit.


In a lot of countries it means one thing, especially when sailors do it.


As we walk up, I'd like to trail back by Grog in the rain. The killing's going to start soon. It's not going to stop. We're going to protect them. All of them. (laughter)


Ooh! How did you do that? (exclamations)


I give it to Scanlan.


Do we have, really, an element of surprise at this point?


Deeply honored by your thought, sir. Thank you.


Would that be as strong as the rest of the building?


Maybe we should duck down, so that nobody knows where that came from.


No, none of it.


Because we save it for when it really counts!


I'm taking a shot.


But that was years ago!


I'm still interested. I would like to see the quality of the book. You know, see if it's in mint condition.


I know. C'mon, Pike!


You can place it to where it might hit both of them and not us.


Both-- 25.


That was more of a distraction.


This is clearly a case of the husband favoring the wife.


I would expect no less.


This is stressful.


20 feet. Can she get up onto the platform opposite of Beau? How much further can she go? Can she get to hooded snake, Cobra Kai?


I don't see a change, I'm not sure.


I thought you stayed back.


One-eyed prick named Vecna.


I mean, it is not totally unheard of. The legends in history are full of stories of the gods dabbling with mortals. I don't know what happened for you today, but-- it is not common, but it does happen.


And roll for the DC.


And tell Frumpkin to go up that side and we will go up the other side.


We'll pretend to be your small army. You are our leader.


No, fuck it, I'm going to stay right there.


We did want some proof.


Because I'm not an asshole.


Oh, I cast Cure Wounds on myself.


We travel back down the---


That's eight plus 11, so that's 20--


Approval?


With-- not-- no!


Okay. Who all's around him? Pike and Grog?


(nervous) It's all right. It's fine. We don't care about the horses. Let's just save ourselves. Who cares about the horses?


Somebody punch me. (punching sound)


I wasn't still hidden?


I just wanted to know if they had happy families, that's all, you know.


Well. Fuck it, I'm going to land and touch Grog.


(Grog voice) It was lost on me. Your subtle humor is lost on me.


Storybooks in Syngorn.


Everyone check out the D&D Beyond booth!


I'm looking over the book.


(sing) Why can't we be friends?


All right, I will. Are you familiar with levers? Things that move up and down?


To a girl named Lauren Spizzick or something.


Does that change my modifier at all? When it goes up that much?


I don't even know what that means.


That was impressive. You put her in her place.


Can I add my inspiration to that?


Do it for Percy. Do it for Pike.


Here, Nott. You can read this now.


Okay. I try and earth clear.


(squealing)


Right, 3d4. Okay.


Cheers to that.


Besides, did you see how many posts on that board were all revolved around ratting people out?


It is a calculated risk and we are going to do this. We are not going to take a lot of time.


Well, I have taken up enough of your time.


Heal myself. That's 19 points healed.


Oh, just attack? I'm going to use Luck. 12?


Okay. It's not my strong point. Goddamn it, that's like the fourth three I've rolled today.


If Felicia's in that, it's gonna be fun.


Oh. Where is he located, exactly?


Yeah, slow down, you're doing all the shit.


Well, I'm done playing, so I'm going to take the Titan Stone Knuckles and smash them together and cast Enlarge on myself.


What does that Owl's Wisdom do?


I imagine you're sitting here going--


Do I have a sense of what aggros it?


Okay, cool. That's actually great to know. I'm actually happy about that.


If you run, we'll kill you.


I'm going to go into the room that I see is for sure empty, and go toward the threshold of the ramp.


That was pretty cool, Gramps.


You know when you sneeze and turn, and pulls the rib out.


I'm down 42, but I could probably heal--


Please. Grog always leaves his mark.


Shit, we just blew those.


Probably to look and not touch.


Yes, we'll come back and check on Kiri. Be a good girl, Kiri.


I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you guys very much. But maybe I'll see you more often?


Do we go in the direction?


Let's all take Aid. I will, and so will they.


Remember, the argument was also that it will be magically treated to withstand simple acid.


Choked you with my stick?!


Are you stealthed?


Oh, where do I want to see it? Maybe his torso area.


I run over to Percy and pour a healing potion in his mouth, and I don't "in him." (laughter)


14 damage!


Whoa! Pike should read it.


Oh, yeah, we've got to go on Honesty Hour now. Give them the whole shebang. Ride the feels.


The stairs are a metaphor. Each stair that we get across is going to be like another step further into defeating Vecna. You know? With each stair-- I'm winded.


Well, she left already.


I'll take second watch, then.


Tell us how you taxidermy it.


Maybe the Slayer's Take.


I'm going to go down on it with my knee. Jump up and knee down on it.


Are you okay? I know the day's escapades were a bit much. Little close.


Hey! Nobody can see me! (clanking noises)


The poop is right there.


To not have. That's a big fucking difference.


What did you do? Give me those! I punch them both, one time each, in the jaw, just for extra measure.


There's Siouxsie and the Banshees, they're all right.


I have the carpet, I'm going to head towards that small--


Yeah, but actually do you think you could go back and say that you forgot to ask a question?


All right, I'll take the potion myself.


Did everyone hear Percy, that's a good idea.


Do we know where?


While they're debating I spit out four globules of light and start casing the room.


Is he still alive?


Did Pike and I notice anything when we ripped out this darkness from his chest?


Going up to catch the golden bitch!


It's true. So, it's www.critrole.com, and, yeah, and the site is still under construction, so. But we managed to rush it out, and I wanna give a huge shout-out to Michael Whitesman, who's a big friend of ours, for helping us make the website


You know how to kill them?


That was more substantial.


Son of a fuck.


Hells yeah.


(laughing) It's not the worst it could be. Thanks. I'm not stabbing you the worst I could.


Percy, we've got cows!


That's good, that's a 16!


No, it's a trap ready to hit me.


You don't have to do that.


You leave the table when you've got the pot. You don't wait for everything to go back to the dealer.


That was fucking intense.


Hit it.


I've got plastic on my character.


But I don't know where I'd end up?


50 hit points a round?


Which is another d6, plus half--


I don't have any-- I mean, I can try to look for traps or something, but--


She's made of armor.


Oh, speaking of, I stand up and I walk to the door where the little kid was pulled from.


Yes! I want to do that.


I'll grab onto her britches as she's doing it.


God, it's ironic that I don't even know how to do that.


Yeah, we've been hurting him pretty bad.


Of Wilhand's place?


(laughs) A word of advice. If, as you're finding your way out of town, you were to stop by a certain cave, there might be some things for you to pick up.


Traps, traps, under the bed. I want to look under the bed.


It would make me feel better if he was thrown in prison.


I'm in there, yelling into the water right now because it's been too much.


Does he have any pretty buttons?


State fair, all the way.


Booming energy, yes.


(laughs) We're smart.


Yeah, what was that Scarlet Prison you just mentioned, under the what now?


I pull a level two healing potion, just get it in his mouth.


It gives you an additional 19 hit points. Temporary hit points. So add plus 19 on top. When you lose them, they're gone. Huh?


I'll stay 60 feet within the surface of the earth.


It's a small shack.


I will let Frumpkin continue and watch.


I am, too.


Wow, that's a good insight check.


Keyleth meteor, what?


Like water splashed on a cat.


What have you heard?


Guys, I think this is one of our tightest games.


But I also think we've earned more than a single day of rest.


Sorry. Good morning. I forgot you're grumpy when you wake up.


Thank you, I often get confused with Phillip the Terrible.


Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole?


(sing-song) Mine rolled the best of the three dice!


Yeah, I'm going to go up to Percy and cast Protection from Evil on him.


No, that doorway is in no way safe.


28 on the first.


Am I going to die? Did you just kill me?


Is there something under the lake?


Yeah. He hasn't obviously gotten there, right?


Jingle jangle jingle jingle.


At the moment he'd be speaking, okay, so let's do that.


I put my head on his shoulder. What you doing?


Thank god he's wearing that armor, huh?


Oh. Toys.


Oh fuck. Were there any other pockets of water along the way?


Do you not want healing potions, or what?


Yeah, but we could carve out ice tunnels.


Piece of shit.


Taking those mushrooms.


That is a company laptop. Pointing that out.


I feel like I-- Yes, I'm going to do it.


Even gingerly?


A lot of good it did you.


That was pretty good, darling. We'll talk later. It really was. It was very good.


Taliesin's on an iPhone 2 over there.


I hate this. I'm going to stand up, and walk over to Cree.


Like the salt on the rim of a margarita, phosphorus through my hand.


Tiberius. Little darling!


What about the other animals?


I will send the other one that way as well.


All right, deadeye sharpshooter. Thank god. This is just sucking. Oh my fucking god. I miss.


Oh, with advantage.


Not on this show. What?


I'm going to jump onto your shoulders now. So, I take a jump and try and land on the shoulders. Straight acrobatics?


I've never seen your eyes glaze over like that Matt.


Right, right.


We did!


I want it to be by its eye.


Oh, wait, once he's within 15 feet of me, he gets half speed. Oh, no, he's not walking.


Are you? You sent that woman to kidnap me.


I reach forward, throw that leg towards the right knee again. Still working on the same spot.


May we speak? May we have a moment of your time?


I've got it, but I'm busy with Trinket.


Did you see any survivors?


We'll be out of town in a week.


What if he's a tuning fork?


Like a rock hammer.


All of us. We're going to kill this thing--


We could stop by later and tell them that both their problems have been handled.


It's like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals.


Go! Can we go faster?


Open market, right?


If we turn him in, it’ll take attention off of us in case we have trouble getting out of the sewer. But maybe we need to know who this is.


Okay, shit. Should've called Sharpshooter. All right, so the first one is one, plus eight is nine--


You know, like-- Yeah. Waterworld.


During which I pick up Scanlan's shawm and start playing it terribly. No idea what I'm doing. Do you blow into this, are there strings? I don't know.


Yes yes yes.


Where is the captain's quarters?


Mercer-ful.


And 12 points of Eldritch.


Shawm.


That would narrow it to two in my mind. If it's in the Lucidian Ocean. One is far northwest of the Darktow and one is more straight east by several hundred miles.


Kind of?


There'll be a body curing, if it is his house. We'll know, because there'll be a body curing and getting nice and ripe.


This is for Scanlan, he's on his way. And then we have-- Oh, we have the little mouse here.


Did I already Hunter's Mark him now?


Noted, noted.


Making them want an encore, huh.


(strained) Together we could do so much, we could dry eraser-board the planet.


She just, I mean, she gives you your drink, so I think it's a nice woman to me.


Can I hear the noise of the ziggurat coming from either side more?


We did start this campaign in a different thing. We started in Pathfinder and for a lot of us, me included, that was the first time playing D&D, so Matthew home-brewed everything in Pathfinder, and then right before we decided to do this, we switched over to 5th Edition.


Yeah. Cool, cool, cool.


I point to a spot for Percy to see if I can get them to gather there, and I start readying a Fireball to launch.


I want to learn all of the martial arts.


On the first day we were on this boat, me and Beau and others were going to go into Avantika's cabin and snoop around.


Am I still hidden? No? That exposes me, do I have to hide again? How do rogues work?


Freundes.


Do you have somewhere to put it?


Okay. So, I’m going to take out my hand, and I’m going to Guiding Bolt him.


Technically we left. You three are here.


Probably to shit in an alleyway.


It's like a deity.


How far is the closest one?


I think I've literally made 200 gold since we've met, minimum, at this point. It's been like a week.


We do and we have some boar meat.


Oh, it only lasts for a minute?


You there! Hello.


I'll spin around and try and Eldritch Blast that last pot in the other cage. At disadvantage. That's a 19!


Oh, the whispers! So many whispers. How are the Cowboys doing, Travis?


No, no pressure!


You and I are the same age.


A teeny gnoll.


Well. (grunts) Fire breath!


I'm still going! We're still going. I'm not standing and watching.


We're walking. Are you all right?


Yeah. I'll spend another two points.


Little bit of Kit.


That’s some dark shit! That’s some dark shit!


I can. I don't currently have Locate Object with me.


I'm going to check for 25.


If it's midnight, I would take Aid, just in case he comes in the morning, and if he doesn't, no harm done, you rest up anyway, right?


Oh, yeah, well then I'm great. Fuck, I'm forgetting everything, I'm so nervous!


It's in my stomach.


Burn the bodies. Fuck it.


Well, that hits. Of course it does.


Oh, that's much better. 20.


Total. So I've used three.


I thought you were the only one who had everything figured out.


As close as I can get toward the trapdoor.


Like a crazy grandma in the woods.


Target has advantage on that save if it's triggered by that damage.


Well, listen, I found out where Kord is. He's in a place called--


Should you make me some something teensy?


That's okay. (counting) That's 12 points of damage.


When the cameraman is laughing at you, you know it's a good roll.


Beau goes out, grabs a bunch of pillows from the couches and starts throwing them in.


Gentlemens and ladies. Ladies and gentlemen, we are traveling from far away. We just arrived from Emon. We are fascinated to see your underground city and to celebrate the occasion I would like to buy every dwarf in here a round. Bartender!


Yeah I think it's around that way? I don't know.


Can I ask a shitty question?


With ten more feet! Can I be like  Excuse me. Excuse me, Nott. Sorry.


Love-love.


Look at this. She's got her dice bag. Oh my god.


Two sponge rollers.


Anyone else need some healing? Anything real quick?


Maybe Greater Restoration her.


He's going in the door.


That's as far as I can get? All right, I'll go invisible until my next turn.


That's not actually a terrible idea. Because at the worst I just fall off one side or the other into the boiling blood-- I'll just stay in the ring of fire. I don't want to test the Sriracha pit just yet. Because he's prone, do I get advantage on the attacks without having to use Reckless?


(whispers) Give it back to him.


Maybe you should be a whale.


This one was-- I was going to do a Travis impression.


That's what I thought it was. The yellow one?


It's nothing.


Don't kill this corpse! Don't stab this corpse!


No, I'm not. Is there any blood?


Yes! How do I use this, though?


I'm not going to shoot you.


We've established the--


Look at all those books!


Are you immune to any kind of damage?


It's like playing croquet at this point, so yes. (laughter)


Always Keyteor.


No, Nott!


Okay, so the first is ten plus-- wah!


You walk up in this terrain.


As long as some of my cellular remains are there, I might be able to see a little bit into the room.


It's raining up there.


Don't attach your body norms to it, man.


Whoa, so cool!


He'll tell me!


Pros, we get to visit the Menagerie Coast, which is always really cool.


Ah, no, towards you, Matt, was my intention, yeah.


Oh, I'm sorry. I was waiting on my first request before.


You grew up in a hotel?


But look. I mean, two big-ass, right at the dinner table, we're real far away. Going to take a hot minute for us to get there. The bell's been rung.


You said "Sumalee," not "So Molly," right?


Can I pick up my caltrops?


Oh, it's half every time.


I took some time to learn how to be just a little bit more stealthy.


Okay. I caw-caw closer


They're all grouped together?


I'm going to move into the mansion.


Of course, of course.


Clarota, do you know anything about these passages?


Okay, so I'm going to go up to the giant, where the open wound is, where that guy just broke it open. I have Sprinter's Boots, if I can't get all the way up to it.


Hello Wilhand!


Do you want to ask them with that stink face?


Excellent, let's stand right here. I casually pull out the wire and I cast Message to Nott. Nott, would you please go, I need you to speak to Avantika and Jamedi together for a moment, please?


Kit, I love you so much, so much.


You really should've tried that when he was speaking English.


My dominated guy is not going to live to see his--


As an action, if it's my turn again, I will attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind.


Get the baby.


That doesn't seem like a very good idea.


And keep the money at the same time.


I was Eldritch Blasting him.


I won't be a burden or anything, but if you don't mind me coming, I could use the help. The swamp, I've tried to go out in it by myself, and there's something out there.


Ruby!


Concentration? Is it plus anything?


I don't know? I don't see her?


He said looking pretty rough.


Well, after his testimony, should it prove to be valuable.


No, it's fine. Yeah, I can be your wife. I can RP this. I mean I can pretend to be. Yeah. So Coralin Shorthalt.


Undecided, I don't know.


Help out?


I can't make Doty do things, can I?


Can I keep an ear out for anything approaching?


Added damage.


Do you think that works?


I just-- I don't feel the dice were necessary at that point.


Yeah, it's a lot different kind of game.


If I may. We didn't choose to dump ourselves right in the middle of the city. That was born out of necessity, not out of choice. The task we set out to finish proved a lot more complicated than originally perceived. Frankly, I worry about the safety of the city of Kraghammer. Underneath their home down in the bowels of the earth, I'm don't know how much the council knows about the race of the illithid. We stumbled into a veritable hornets' nest of them below the city.


Is that the shapes and pie-making game that you play in the kitchen bakery?


Wow. It's beautiful. Thank you.


Vines.


Yes. It's the easiest level.


We're not in the forest anymore? This is bog?


You tried to talk out what?


He's so hairy, we hardly notice.


Okay, okay. Gotta put the foot down before this gets weird.


Since he made an attack, can I?


So he does 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage. I'm also water elemental, so I believe he has water susceptibility, correct?


Oh good, you showed up!


So I've already rolled a 13, plus a d4. This is not going to go well, is it? d4 is another one. That's 14.


That's adding my wisdom.


So then, I'm so sorry, I can't see the squares. So if I can get ten to get over there.


I think we're going to have to move deeper in.


I know. That's the problem. None of us want to do anything.


Is it wine?


Hey, we're here to see Bryce.


Okay. Goddamn it, really? 12.


I don't want to jump the gun, but I did punch a volcano today. This door, probably not too big a tuna for me to filet, you know what I mean? Unless the runes say, "If you punch, melt you will."


They were walking towards us.


Yeah, I get it all the time!


Get three lodestones, bring it back, don't kill him because he is responsible for you guys not sinking into the ocean.


I cast Haste on Beauregard.


Does appear to be trapped.


(glumly) I know what he rolled.


Eww.


We've brought a little bit of the evil with us.


We need the assistance of guards, guys.


Ja. They would kill us; we watched them skinning the inhabitants of this--


I don't expect us to be in and out of here, I think this is going to take some time.


Oh, I'm still here? Oh, I'm still here!


Dripping wet.


I'm gonna keep an eye out for a moment, for a little bit.


So the daggers did it.


It screws a high roll.


In his talons, he could bring a little mouse and drop it in there. I'm just saying.


Is it a stupid idea to shoot another Oracle Arrow through this one and see if it looks the same?


Yes. Of course she is.


Donut hole! Donut hole! Donut hole!


(laughing) "Should we have some--"


What thing is that, Percival?


Was it the salt-water dream?


I ain't wasting that shit!


It's the con plague. We just got back from New York.


Instead of three.


Into Westruun?


That helped it, yeah. That gets it to 20.


I'd like a drink--


Would you say they are at odds?


Okay, wait, you guys run.


I sit down on the WC.


Yeah, definitely. Yeah.


You forgot to mention the part where you vomited and blew our cover.


Really? Describe her to me in vivid detail.


It is, okay.


It's not Thunder Wave?


Well, don't expect us to be okay with this. That's not going to happen.


No. (whispering) But we found someone and something.


I heard the bear and I start sliding my back down along the wall.


29. Damn it, he does?


Oh, football! Yeah. Okay! Cool.


(laughs) With advantage.


I have two vials of underwater breathing from a long time ago. How long do those last?


Are they supernatural? Are they undead?


(coughs) and I'm holding.


You don't know that.


Ooh, it even smells good. It smells like home!


I have a pickaxe that I picked up before we left.


Let's find that six-year-old.


That was almost the name of this show. Not as catchy.


You opened this hole, man, you gotta pay for it!


Ooh! Who wants this creepy looking shit?


I place my hand on Scanlan's shoulder and say: I'm sorry. I know this is hard for you. The bear lives.


I'm a little-- you be my eyes. It's super dark.


We need that sack!


Okay, put those on the table and then we will look at some other stuff first. Okay! I have six short swords, and I put them down on the table. I've got two daggers here! I've got two hand crossbows! Two light crossbows and two heavy crossbows!


So we're going to take them all? Hop on both of his offers, I think?


Wait, but she did something.


Sure am! Yep.


Why do people like calling you elf boy and elf girl?


Sorry. Yes. Lead the way.


No. There's something of a magical nature up there.


No, there's no grudge. They pretty much think I'm dead, because after I whooped his son's ass, he whooped my ass.


Okay, okay. As we walk I'll be like  You know what, guys? I've had a lot of time to think over the year that we've been away--


There's a fight coming here. You don't want to be here. Don't be too obvious about it, on the sly, if you can, but try and make your way out of here before dawn tomorrow.


Are we in a weird in-between combat and non-combat?


There was a jar full of-- they're like boba. It's food.


In case you have to look weird. Do you have to look weird while you do this?


I completely stayed away from it, because I was terrified.


Boring.


So, but, set fire to the house, right? Burn the whole city down?


Where's the meteorite die?


Let's go. Let's go. Everything's fine here too, by the way.


Oh! Okay! That's good--


I can use hit dice?


Save versus wisdom?


Is it a busy night? Any new travelers, anyone that caught your eye coming in before us?


Was it? We must have all seen it, but–


I'm doing real good.


Who runs it, then?


Half-elves!


There's only a few rooms in this place, right?


In theory. So if we do not use them to attack dragons, can we at least use them to do something? Because they will no longer ever be our allies again after today. We could use them to go try to kill the dragon on their own, we could use them to try to kill something or someone else for us, we could use them to try to help clear the city, if we convinced them that it was in their best interest to--


Yes, Vax?


It feels like that gold was stealing from the dragon, just slowly but surely.


Every fucking thing is expensive here.


Okay, some, like, yoga music?


I don't know if that's going to work at all.


Solid. So some people go up, you come back, turn the rest of the people in.


I know! So maybe you should remember that you have it and give it to fucking Grog!


His penis!


That's fine. This is flametongue. I don't know if fire helps, but that is an eight. So nine and an eight.


And we always give each other presents from our characters. And it's probably my favorite thing, ever.


This is amazing!


Can he add his Bardic Inspiration?


A scat grenade.


Sure! I'll go to the warehouse and try to break in.


She lives inside of you.


You get advantage?


I can only cast it on one person, though, Keyleth. I don't have, I'm not as good with spells as you, so if you can do it to multiple people, it might be good.


It's brand new!


You guys, I kicked this cat today, and it fucking evaporated. (laughter)


Oh, 26.


I'm still a planetar. Do you still have Bigby's Hand up?


Monster calves.


Filing it away.


I'm going to take a moment to use Primal Awareness and see-- is there a way to sense krakens? Or anything.


I look at the man who's off to side. I agree with you that finding your loved ones is most important. I believe we can actually maybe do a little bit of both here and solve both problems. Me, alongside with the help of other magic users, can help quickly build an underground bunker. And I would be willing to help escort any party to Kymal in order to help find your people. Whereas I do agree, to an extent, with Percy that we should not let Westruun fall to this, this city is only as great as its people.


Oh yeah, no.


So like, a medium range roll, like a 15,16, 17-- Hit the hydra, killed Beau.


We may be fuck-ups--


I think you've had enough. I'm going to smell the coffee. It's really coffee?


Why not?!


They're well known. Everyone there knows them. There's no way to not know them.


I assume that would make us pretty blind as well.


Name one.


But I don't have to be standing to cast a spell--


You sound like Kim Carnes. Everybody, this is great. (all laugh)


We have two basilisk eggs we’re willing to part with.


Pike, we've missed you so much.


Now, normally we will play until seven tokens, but for the purposes of this video, we'll play until three. Whoever gets three is gonna win. Let's play. Pass out your cards Becca, one to each.


Should we report this to the officials and try to quarantine the house, destroy it, something?


Is it something that can be taught to others?


(sighs) I don't know what to do. I'm preparing for anything. When I got thrown into that dungeon, I came to the realization that maybe I wasn't doing this the right way. I wasn't being responsible, and I prayed to whatever it is I pray to that maybe I would have a sign of what I should be doing, and then there you were. I've been trusting that Vox Machina will take me where I need to go, and maybe what I need to do is confront this, but I don't know what this is, and I'm terrified.


Okay. No? Okay. Precious little I can do. I will Lightning Bolt it. Ooh, I'm right next to it.


Bigger than Trinket?


(laughs) Give me 50 more platinum.


I think that's a fucking terrible idea.


(caws)


Percy and I spend some time making some really nice comment cards for--


Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest.


We're at Burning Man, aren't we? We're at Burning Man.


I will begin my ritual spell in the same spot.


I'll go ahead and very-- I'm just gonna kinda use my keen sense-- or sorry, my keen smell again to see if I can smell any duergar in the area.


I don't know what the fuck that means!


We're real sorry about your house.


Well, we weren't technically dating when we killed her, so I'm not really sure if she'd know.


Destroy reality?


This is becoming a thing.


You're different, too!


Is it close enough to us?


Especially not against harpies.


I want to know its damage vulnerabilities. What's it vulnerable to?


I rolled a 30. I want to get down in a crouch and just run right there.


What do we get?


Since I am also gold-poor, I'm writing it into the letter to my sister that we owe money, that they are to employ him in any way he sees fit.


Shut the front door!


Kick his ass, Grog!


No, I was there. I was with you.


Time is a gift, I would say.


Where have you guys been?


I would like to go around here.


To the right and up.


The whole time! You, me, Jamedi, and Avantika in the front.


What do you have under that cloak? Is it weapons?


Oh, right. My facts are--


We've got some shopping to do, we've got to run around a bit.


Or to Avantika.


That one's a 19.


I like him. Can I put my finger in the cage?


To the other side of the wall, yeah.


I can go get the thing.


Because Circle of the Moon, bitch.


Corner three.


You are so fucking lucky it did that. (laughter)


I was trying to be stealthy!


Gilmore, if they were after us and they were after you, they were probably also after Allura. We need to make sure that everyone on the Council is okay.


There's a fine line between psycho and practical.


So the arrow's not still lit? It just went through? Can you Light, Tiberius?


The colors are quite nice.


Okay, tiny is uncalled for, but I understand. The faces of your tribe, of your clan. All right.


I'm going to hold on one side, you're going to hold on the other, and we'll do it together. Percy, can I borrow your blade?


Can you teach us how to say that in Elvish?


I caught it! Argh!


Something's going to happen to me and it's going to be bad. Six. 11. 23.


All right, going down.


Impressive. And she didn't really use magic, so that's good. Bonus points there.


Be worth a pretty penny?


Gently! You should be careful with that. Those can make big booms.


On Hotis.


Wow. Let's see what we do. That's (counting) 11 points of damage?


We were caught off-guard by this whole thing. She was teaching me the swirley-whirley while this was all going on.


Not near us right now.


Oh, you read Elvish?


Okay, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds. I'm going to walk up behind Caleb and give him a hug around the waist and say: you're okay, my friend.


So anyone lower would be an enemy, anyone higher would probably--


If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel, and we'll leave.


Well, your word is not important.


Yes! Okay. 14.


Plus anything?


We usually have one cow.


Are we just at the edge of the pond?


We just figured we would make sure that you were aware we were here. We don't want to ruffle any feathers and we don't necessarily know who are the right people, the wrong people to work for.


I wanna keep hitting the water elemental.


Swing it around.


Once you have a child, I want you to turn on a dime like a Tartuffe character and be matronly and severe.


Yeah, of course, but Vecna's whispering in my ear. 33 and Pass Without a Trace, so 43.


Hi, good to see you, Keyleth.


I've got a party planned for you!


Her forearms are amazing.


Happy Festivus.


I'm picking up one of the arms--


-- whilst she tries to heal him, just in case he gets all sucky on her.


Okay, that's way better! 24!


No no no, I'm good. I'm good. You stay. I don't want to blow our cover, I'm going to do this all underground.


Hey girl!


Unnatural 20.


You have inspired people. G-T-F-O, man.


Seven for the second, and eight for the third.


There are four sides. Who wants to come on my side?


That means he likes me.


Can I hit my earring up, and go  Giant! Giant! Being attacked! Help!


You're an emoji?


Our music, it’s gone.


Which none of you can do. Other than monks, of course.


Should we look around the room and make sure nobody can spy on us? Look for peepholes in the room.


You're not stealth anymore. You got a busted foot. You're at disadvantage on everything.


Why don't you just check the two that are unknown to us, that are negative?


We return the bow. I return the bow.


I see it?


Go get them and see if we can get them.


Yeah, I'm going to go 15 feet back under the table. I can't hide, but I'm going to get under there because it's not that smart.


Are there exits?


He was human?


We could kill them quite easily.


You know, in my readings of this place, the Hells-- Of any hell, really (laughs)-- They typically are, at least in literature, reflected as horrible places where lots of bad things happen wherever you go. So having a deal presented in front of us that is not horrible is, I think, a pretty winning deal. I mean, I feel like we're already ahead of the game if we are not being actively murdered during the course of events.


Do you think that guy went and alerted everyone about Vecna?


To the Iron Shepherds. Right, okay.


This is true! Pike? They know you.


Did you mean to give it to him?


Oh, it's just the fucking coolest.


With Pike and I.


I wanted to head towards the alchemical stuff to see if there's--


We're going to set her up so that she's nice and--


I'm going to try to drink underwater.


Yes, thank you.


His name is probably Jamal Porter.


Well, not like a fireplace mantle. Although I could, technically, transform into a fireplace now.


And that's everything.


Oh, that hits.


Which is 20. If I'm fully equipped.


That's what I have!


I'll take one more level two potion right now.


He likes cursing, I guess.


--and he can’t read the exact amount?


Is this my day-birth or something?


He's trash talking! Don't listen to him!


Well, it's owned by someone, isn't it? Someone deserted it.


As we go, I'm looking at clotheslines for any sort of beret type of a hat. (laughter)


Did you aerate it first?


Herewolves?


I wouldn't let him.


I assume the one that isn't on fire, but you know, that's my opinion.


Yeah, we're all awake.


That was the first damage. The second damage I haven't done yet.


Just like his soul.


Vex is right.


(laughs) Nice!


So I'm sure they wiggle every now and then anyway.


I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to hold off on that for a little bit.


Grab the body. Let's go.


Yay!


Is that what I have? That's the thing here. I'm going to load that up with an Invisibility spell. Is that a thing I could do?


I'm going to check his desk upstairs for anything interesting.


Does not hit!


It's fun, right?


I'm going to make my roll. Come on. What do I have to roll? (muttering) I hit the difficulty. Does that--


You took, like, a failed Californian sketch and turned it into Oscar-winning material.


We'll find out. Maybe he'll be super easy.


(gasps) Oh, good!


The frying on this chicken is exquisite.


We're about to pop out.


But I could get rid of some other stuff.


Fuck him. I go to sleep. (laughter)


And ask, so, I thought you were interested in Keyleth. Am I wrong? I mean, you're interested in Keyleth. Right? I mean, I know you don't want to tell me. I know you don't tell me anything like this, but-- is it weird that he's here?


While all this was going on, can I do a quick little casing, intelligence to see if there's any thrown-away trash, burned evidence, or anything in the back?


No no, one came to swap out the other.


Why would you give him ideas like that? Just feed him irony!


Am I high enough yet for her to jump down onto the--


No, I want to hear about your night.


And she is not flickering anymore, so I can get a good hit on her, as well?


It's directly under the castle. We would have to maybe fill it with, I don't know. Submerge it or some such.


It's a horrifying-looking creature. You are to be commended for your bravery. Lawmaster Norda will want to know about this immediately.


I relay this.


Is that one legendary action, or two?


Might report back with how-- the size of the cave.


So he can save me.


Water is terrible. It tried to kill us! It actively wants to kill us!


Can you move Trinket next to Grog?


What kind of ship was it?


(screams) Shit!


All right, if we're going to leave the keep, I'll need a moment in my room.


Quietly walking this way. We're past the door, that looks like the front door.


Can I jump to the top of the bannister here so I'm looking down at old tangled-up Delilah. (sighs) May I leap off the tower and straight onto Delilah's prone body?


Mairgil. Mare - Mairgil?


Well, we're not replacing Molly.


Would we get healing potions?


On saving throws? If I damage you--


(coughs) It's really good.


Are we waiting here for a while?


Fuck, I'm just going around-- I love you.


You should be really proud it's yours.


Yes, of course I am!


Seven on the hit and then with sneak, another seven's 14, another six is 20 on that. 20 points of damage.


It's a dragon!


We're going to try to get in a building that's closer to the tower.


12. As a shark, right?


Oh. Well, I think I understand a little about that, too. There's things that I want to change as well. Things that would be risky to change. But sometimes you have to take a big risk, if it's that important.


Please feel free to speak.


We--


When it is time to pour the acid, we will undoubtedly make sure that you are on the front-- not yet--


Krull?


Okay, but I'm--


No, he ran away when he was a legionnaire.


Remind me to show you my tapestries.


If anyone's wondering why so many Batman cards are being drawn, it's because there are five in the deck. There's either one or two of all the other characters. So I draw, and I will play, myself, Poison Ivy. This card says, choose any player including yourself to discard his or her hand, and draw a new card. Ivan, you look pretty confident. Discard.


Oh yeah, that's a one.


Bats come out during the day!


We fought stitch monsters, that was mostly what we... it was guns and swords and...


Your shirt's so dope, too.


We think well of you and move on.


I love this shit. It's like walking into a Toys 'R' Us. It's the fucking best. It's like, "Which way do I go?!"


You have to sleep with a glass of water by the bed.


(Southern accent) You're talking like that.


Keep going. There you go.


Oh. Can you stab it right now? Maybe it's still breathing?


17 as well.


You said the waterfall goes up a thousand feet.


Caleb, how long does your string theory work?


Just go down the line.


Well, I seem to know fuck-all about it. Ten.


That is how I wanted to die. Fighting the dragon.


How do you get un-swallowed?


Did I find any loot in the bodies of the losers? The little guys?


How about this? I'm not afraid. If he takes offense, I'll take it better than most.


That's a good question. Vax, how are you feeling?


We don't need them anymore.


Yeah. It burns people like I burned that man.


Get a battle perspective?


He just means out of the ordinary, yeah?


We're also going to need any and all recruits that you may know of, or any favors you can call in. If we are in fact going to fight this dragon?


These white gloves are sullied. I need a new set of white gloves, please.


Is bacon what we're fighting for?


To the tavern?


We aren't here to bury him. He's already in the ground. We've come to avenge him and we were hoping to find some help in these parts.


Keyleth, can you cover the entrance to where we are to give us a little bit more of a stealthy--


I don't pay attention to that shit.


You see that, Caleb, that's almost as powerful as the shit that you do.


I'm going to put my metal, scary mask on.


As well as the lovely Dani Carr that we all know and love. The lovely Brittany Walloch from All Work No Play fame.


Yep. Look, she's like, "Mmm, please stop touching me."


Okay, I am freaked out right now. These are very large individuals. I have only read about them, and they smell slightly like feet. So I am going to-- that is a stench. That is like an athlete's foot commercial waiting to happen. So I am going to take 10d6 and do Disintegrate.


Good way to phrase that, Scanlan. Also, I would like to check out any places where they might have enchanted libraries or what not.


Yes. What did you say?


Yeah. Or just to its side, at least?


I put one of my hands through their heads.


(singing) Jester got run over by a reindeer.


Oh, but I am calling out, and yelling at, and taunting at the guy. And it's just this. (mouthing words)


All right, then from this spot, if they're in range, I'm going to throw Whisper at one of them.


I'm flipping and climbing vines and shit.


Yeah, I've totally forgotten that, I'm just totally stunned at this point. That's good, that's 32.


Okay. I'm above 100. So I have no idea if that has anything to do with what's going on here.


Maybe, he's probably hiding somewhere.


To 13?


Yeah. Yes. And the whole thing is gonna be charity-related, it's all gonna go to 826LA.


I can hear it, but I can't see it.


But make sure he doesn't bleed out first.


All right, a little bit over, that's workable.


Can you recommend any bookstores here in the city?


I mean, I can't use my crossbow as a melee-- no.


Grog, you're already a good jumper, right?


Ooh, what is this? Druid stuff.


I think I might have an idea. Okay, we know the white dragon is vain.


I walk up.


It might be touch.


Can I ask a question? Is that all right?


Yeah. In fact, any time I take him out of the scabbard, why don't you hang real close. I might have to plunge him into your thigh or something.


I pick up Pike, and we start running.


Okay. I can't lightning arrow them again, though.


Basically an Irish breakfast.


Lots of them around here?


It's just semantics. Attack-attack, hasted action, bonus action. So that was the first of my attack-attacks. And here's the second one.


Why are you so evil?


Oh, look how teeny! I can finally see it.


Do I have a reaction?


You should go in there, see if you can disengage the trap.


Oh, also are our horses dead?


Most people who come here know what this place is, this is going to be delightful. I've never had to explain it to someone before.


That's brutal.


Okay. Have any of them been hurt yet?


Okay. It's not that bad.


That's a bad idea. Let's go in.


Was there anything else in there?


Weird question  if I were holding the blue gem and had dropped it down this hole, what would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up?


Yeah, classes. You know, writing, creative writing.


I think it's much worse.


Oh. Because of the thing?


You got Dis.


You would tell us if something was wrong?


He's an ally now.


She used Shield, which is a reaction, so she can't hit me with an attack of opportunity. Never mind.


I appreciate your excitability. Why don't I let the bird do the talking?


Oh, jesus. It begins.


Yay! (Loud computer noise in the background.)


I'll be behind him.


Okay, I'll look at that guy who's right in front of me--


Bear claws. Well let's see. Excuse me? Whoever's running this show.


One of them.


Nah, I'll just do this. 18.


No, I'm Tary-ing this-- Tarying this--


Yeah, that would be--


I confess, having spent so much time on the water, the command over it seems like too great a gift to receive, but I crave it. [cheering]


He was handing out weapons.


In Giant I call back, fuck you!


I came across too harshly that night.


No. No, we don't. We just wanna slow things down for a while. It's been a long couple of months.


For Grog. (crash in the background)


I feel like we just killed FernGully.


I did what?


I have a bag of colding.


No, I'll run in.


Can you help me up?


It was definitely a strong six.


Wait, Scanlan, can we store things here, or does it all disappear as soon as we leave?


Well, thank you for your business, I have a lot to do. And I am going to attempt to lift the crate of paper.


Hi! Taryon Darrington. New member of the group. Hi.


And Kaorijimal.


I'm interested either way. So I'm going to stand up and start heading upstairs.


Oh, don't worry about that, Grog. I'll just cast Fly on you, because I can fly.


I don't really understand what she's saying.


Which one? (laughter)


Wait. Can I do a Mass Healing Word as my bonus action?


Fucking hell is right.


You're not awake.


You've got a decision to make. We've got sleep to get.


(pigeon coo)


But if you could fly--


Can you send the Grand Duchess in?


Get it, Percy!


Genie hamster.


The Grasping Vine just still hangs out there?


I'm going to scan his surface thoughts, what is most on his mind in that moment.


Yeah, if we want to be a little punk ass bitch about it! We got to take this guy down!


Oh! Roll it! You're the first one.


Yeah, how did that happen?


Oh, sorry. No, I'm going to keep calling them guards.


Wait, no. We have to do it instantaneously.


The skull?


(softly) Yeah.


Seven! Seven points of damage! Wait, and a d6.


When I started this, I talked to a man, at one point. He was the captain of one of the vessels I was on. I told him what I intended to do, and I showed him what I was building. And he said that if I really wanted revenge, if revenge was what I was after, that there would be no stopping it. And there would be casualties along the way, and I would have to give up things, and I would have to hurt people. And that was the price, so that last barrel is because it's not just five names; I know I'm going to have to keep hurting people and that this thing existing is just going to keep hurting people. It's the knowledge that it never ends. It's because I haven't just killed five people. I've killed a lot of people on my way here. I've killed them with you. And it's to remind me that this is what I've chosen.


It turns spirits into potions. That's pretty solid.


Do we talk to this guy? Because I'm about to. We're fucking dicking around, here.


Wow. That's impressive.


There's a subtle difference between selling and selling out.


Oh, yes, yes. I go over and I-- here.


I can carry Scanlan.


You are a walking hazard right now.


Yeah. Oh man. Maybe we could get some rope and a grapple.


17, good enough. 17, I'm rolling good.


Ooh, what is that eyebrow?


It's so close, I know. That's good, though.


We're going to move fast, and I'm going to keep Eldritch Blast charged, and if anything starts to reach closer than other areas of it.


Which is possible.


You also collected lots of dried poo and put it in the Bag of Holding.


Okay. I'll throw my leg over the chair and sit down. Evening.


Oh. Well, Nott and I have robbed people for sure. People with not a lot of money so that we can eat.


Yes. I will identify these objects.


So I take out my silver thread and I start casting the Alarm spell on our room before bed, and then I go to bed.


It's a dwarf?


Okay. Someday, I'm going to know what I'm doing.


Or we can be smoky mist.


Don't ask me. Please don't ask me.


I mean, it was a floating three.


That's still exciting.


Do you tip in the Menagerie Coast? Is there tipping?


Yeah, you know, beginner's luck, right?


Yeah. So right now you're crazy to me.


(singing) Character arc!


I mean, Yrat, we're still easing you in. Freddie has a little more experience than you, and I think that we can put our faith in that.


Ah, Matt.


I want the furthest extent of transmutation and changing reality.


I was kind of prepared for this.


I have been here for so long.


Is there anything else that you're hiding from us? Any other quirks or skills?


I take a shot. Right now.


Come on Grog, finish it!


That was weird, right? Good night.


Oh Jesus. Yeah, bitch. Seven.


Pub crawl.


I will kill them all!


You learned it's badass.


I also have an idea.


I gladly accept.


Look around for potions and stuff.


I wonder if this grate leads up into the Tri-Spires, then. Maybe it means lots of rich people are up here.


I will probably wait to take it back so that I can open it with my good friend, Pike. Because she'll understand that this is an awesome deck.


I saw the show at the Bellagio. It's amazing.


Have we passed any people?


It meant something.


The Whale?!


Let's do the wharf.


Is it submerged in water?


With a gun. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, that's 17 points of damage, plus five psychic. And it has to make a strength saving throw.


Oh, and I'm out of Resolve.


Yeah! Pike's not even here.


I don't get a surprise round because I sprung in there?


We haven't found a winner.


Thunder!


I think that's actually a very good idea.


That's half my movement. Okay, I'll stand up. He doesn't get to hit me, right?


Yes, this was my next question. I, personally, was thinking about getting the hell out of here, but.


While you decide, which way are we going, Percy? West or east?


I run over. You okay?


You shouldn't have killed my cat. [laughter]


Very quickly. Should we flee?


I'm going to start with one of my blades.


I'll go with Vex that-a-way. I can cool lava as we go.


No, that's not cocked. Cocked! 29.


The demon-possessed royal family was my favorite.


I can help them create one.


Hammer down! 14.


There's, like, five jokes I'm not making right now.


I have just enough room in my spell bus to take us all back.


Everybody loves Grog pranking.


Yeah. Freedom of Movement.


He sounds very familiar. Like I said, us gnomes do know each other.


I'm not wrong.


Yeah, so people can't see us. Do you know of anything like that, Scanlan?


She has a bear? We got a bear!


You get a hundred, and you get a hundred!


There's shit cracking. Something popped.


Quick, hide! Hide, quick!


So how many do I roll? That was three--


Yeah, how noticeable is the bent bars?


Kaitiake. (cheering)


Don't we have company incoming?


I should start by thanking all of you for putting yourselves in harm's way again. I did not expect that to go the way that it did, but that seems a repetitive notion at this point.


Okay. Bud? If you fuck this up, Scanlan! Oh, I don't have any more spells, do I, to do it? He can understand me, I just can't understand him, with my Speak With Animals. Shit.


Is he done?


Am I in your line of sight, Jester? Does anybody need that?


We can keep it!


This is an 'I love you' for those awful rolls earlier.


Outside. Outside!


I just go  I see her!


Oh shit. Now I am the master.


I don't know if we can learn that dance.


All right, but if it's too late--


Can I pray to Pelor?


Whoa, that could be so much fun!


All right. 17?


Is that right? No, wait, yeah that's right. Then, 23 to hit-- 21 to hit.


Double the dice. 15.


She'll be fine!


What do I do with these? I don't, all right fine, I'll take them. I collect medicine packs now.


That could mean nothing.


(singing) Cold as ice!


Percy, tell me.


Yeah, you can.


Yes, ask us first.


He was a sailor! That's how I met him!


This is a good plan.


Honestly, I think we both need sleep.


I stay at the mouth of the cave and say, (whispers) Scanlan, are you alive?


I have a gun! (laughter)


Vex'ahlia, would you come up and talk to this--


Oh yeah, that one.


Fried banana.


Oh yes, one of them battered me quite--


Can I give him my Luck?


I did, too.


It lasts until he can make a wisdom check against the spell save DC.


Yeah, the one that Keyleth's people, or cousins, or whatever they are, have been taking.


Because I did Reckless like a ding-dong.


Grog and Pike are.


That mark couldn't have ended up--


So seeing everyone dodge this thing, I'm just like--


We all have plus 10?


Shoot your arrow, too. Shoot your dagger. Whatever.


Okay, first things first, I'm going to--


Correct. We want to look-- if it’s too obvious, it’s the opposite of convincing.


Try that first before I suplex Grog.


This is Silent Image. I can move it. I just can't make it make a sound.


We suffered heavy damage and casualties, but we have returned, successful.


Skittles, motherfucker!


We asked Cassandra to gather people to study the Shadowfell as soon as we did the oracle arrow last time, so it would probably be smart to find out what they've learned before we make our plans.


Oh, this is a Sneak Attack?


I think we should go in through the roof.


You don't know where it goes.


What do you think I meant?


I start running out the hall to Ripley.


Keyleth walks up and puts her hands in the pool.


Each one. One, two, three, one two three.


The deckhand one?


That is 19.


I just came to check in after the recent events in the world, make sure everyone was okay.


Perhaps you can show me some more of your fashions. I love your dress so much.


I take out five ball bearings and drop them into the hole. You hear it hit?


This guy had a rough breakup or something, man.


Salt on the wind, it's amazing.


Do we know for sure he's helping us?


Oh, I give him a gold.


I'll turn and follow him.


We did some talking.


It's not like-- It's not like showy wizard magic.


We're not supposed to like, kissy-face the heads to make some sort of a 3D shape?


Nine! (music)


It's just hell.


I leveled up.


Like, if you were to just define avarice.


Can you text it to us actually?


I'd say one more proper night's sleep, then into the Feywild.


We all know this is going to grow, so we're just getting ahead of the game.


You're so low.


And climb along the opposite side.


Yeah, but it won't be fairy alcohol, but I know.


We've got to heal her!


You're Johnny Storm?


Okay! They're okay, right?


Because that's what you want to stick your finger in.


I am in-between you and them, and I'm going: come on, come on.


Just makes it. For the first Fireball?


Hi, Tary. Pleasure to meet you.


Oh, okay. And what's the M in Machina?


That was a dragon.


The left one.


They come upon a tree in the road and a woman that they despise now, and that is not suspicious because?


I have the robe, too.


Just saying that's how it sounded before, too.


Where's your mama? Do you have a mama? Is she around?


All of. I've only got two of 'em and they're both in his hair.


Aw shit! I just induced panic.


Sorry. That's 20 points of damage and 28 points of damage. 22... wait. 20 points of damage on the first attack.


He's hangry.


The Clasp in Stillben.


No, it only works up.


How are the people doing? Is there a sense of worry, or do you guys feel pretty secure?


Can I keep my stick? (laughter)


One more hand?


Because I'm wearing this.


Still holding him in place.


And we have six talons.


Really? Why?


Tattoo's looking good, though.


We can show you a good time first.


We always move at a medium pace.


It seemed to splurt when I used fire.


We're in the room, we're in the room!


I know! I try so hard, you guys!


Which is pretty rare.


Oh shit, look at that.


The things I'm gonna do in this armor, you're not going to want it back. Just give me and Scanlan one night to break it in, and I promise you, it will be mine.


I don't. But I do draw dicks on a lot of my money. But I don't think I did it to those.


Wait--


No, I'm good. I'm out.


'Cause it's shark week.


Reacting.


It's okay, it left. Big crack in the wall. Might think about leaving. Before you do, the Siren. Where might I find her?


I'm going to try and glean as much information about the nature of the landscape around the person that I'm focusing on as humanly possible.


You got all these ladies and gentlemen in shape?


(sings) Gonna need a montage.


Studded leather?


Nobody got 20 to 15?


Oh, we are.


Do they obey you, or is it a partnership?


I don't want to knock him out, he's cute. 1st-level.


During the dinner? While we were all sitting there?


Shut up! I could see it in my head!


I know, I just feel like now I'm acting like I'm mad, almost, around him. I don't know. He's making me feel so many different kinds of emotions. I'm confused.


Oh boy, this is going terribly.


I wasn't anticipating a rug. But we beat the rug. Get it? We beat the-- we beat it.


Dex, thank you! So that's 1d8 plus dex.


That was just me? I'm the only arcana-trained person here?


I'm very curious to see how this is going to go. I just want to look her over. What is this room? What is happening? What was going on?


Kaylie's Fine, everyone! (laughter)


You can forget it. I won't go in.


We all run out.


Excellent. I'm on top of a pillar, and I'm not within striking distance, right?


Maybe you could just look at it and see with your smarts.


Bring it in, bring it in, give me a hug. Ooh, you smell a little. I like it though. Somehow it works on you.


Do I see any other-- as we're running through--


I hand him a little healing potion, and say, sorry.


Sure. I click my Boots of Haste before he does it.


It was violin class! What?


I think that's smart.


I know that you're embarrassed for wasting your time here, but you will get over it.


This isn't the real game, the game hasn't actually started yet.


I don't think she's coming back, yeah.


What are you going to do? You're one man! You're going to sail the ship away?!


Aw man, I've got to roll for this? I'm going to roll one of my new dice. Well, it's for--


Why I am in your room?!


Matt, my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way.


Just bear-ly.


Ah, Jester!


And where are we?


It says when you hit a fiend or undead with this magic weapon, the creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage.


He can just go  oh, Toto!


I walk by, eating chicken and wearing no pants.


Once this is done, can you cast one of those--


She wants to play again, right now.


He seems like a prat.


Let's just--


I wonder if he knows that we're here.


Times three right?


I'm looking towards where we're going.


And I'm stabbing! Stabbing, stabbing! Stabbing.


I'm maniacally laughing.


I'm going to use my movement to run up around the molten lava and hold my hand out for Gern, so that he can use me to get out of the molten lava.


I will be quiet.


I did not--


Show him your tattoo, I'm just sort of curious. I just had a thought.


We're on a mission, though.


We made our way to the beach.


Jeez louise.


-- and to terrible consequences, to failure.


Well, it's a little late, because I already took mine. I'm waiting to see what's happening.


Then how-- that's fine.


Can you hear me right now?


Can I take a potion really fast?


I don't have that much either. Wait, do I?


Yeah, that's great!


They are interesting, and I'm indifferent to such things.


Anything else we need to do before we leave Emon?


I'm not going to read it until I hear wings flapping.


She's got a badass scythe.


If I'm next to him, because I give plus two to saves, does that futz with it?


Plus seven, yeah!


There's a lot of gasping going on.


We need to go to the pillow place and go get some money from my mom!


We could just copy their plan.


Highbearer Vor-- his name is Vord?


Sir North Korean.


But it's a 300-foot range spell.


No! Goddamn it.


A lot, yeah. A lot riding on this, but-- A little surreal that we're here.


Maybe there's a way to cure it.


And one day will be the last time; what then?


I'm good, I'm good.


(whispers) I would not care to say.


I'll cast Counterspell.


Insight check.


He wants to fight him.


For a round, it's gone.


Hello, Pike. In the flesh, this time. I hope that you've seen that I've been doing as you asked every night.


Except we don't have air conditioning.


I said I was going to meet you here in Zadash.


Aw. Thought we were gonna get a warm up.


I intensify the stink-eye.


Did we-- okay, yeah. Sure. Yeah.


Okay, I'll close the gap and come at it with a big double swing from my staff.


Wilhand, if you don't mind me asking.


Just because he's dead doesn't mean he's a bad guy.


I'll be-- if you--


Oh, high hopes!


No. I thought we were all on the other side of the bridge.


Got any Luck left?


Sasha Gray is a...?


I don't think he saw.


I've never used it, so it should probably work great.


7.


Would you take this as a deposit? I give her this platinum bracelet with a sapphire that I have. We'll get it back when we return the ship. Oh, wait.


Yeah, twice.


I'm scared of it.


Yeah, an insight check. Meh, 13.


I'll go with Scanlan and Grog.


When in hell--


Nothing it can, we took out all the stuff it can turn into some like evil transformer or something.


Tary's staying.


Right, well, I'm gonna just do the Hail of Thorns again.


(sings) There are giants in the sky.


45. Okay. Just to be clear.


I guess, if you didn't even see it. I grabbed something out of it. I guess it was its heart. Now it's gone.


I grab that stool, and I drag it over.


Oh, yes! Of course I do. I have a lot of bandages because I am the cleric.


Does it look like the same one?


I know. It was worth a shot. I'm going to take another shot. Fuck it, I'm just going to go for a sharpshooter, to try and do a little bit more damage to this, and I'm going to burn another grit and get advantage on it.


Don't break that concentration!


Make a skin.


All right, well, that's on the to-do list.


He just was mean.


We also got, apparently, Winestacker. Wang stacker? Yeah, he had something, at the Morrow Keep?


There's flying brooms?!


We don't know.


Zac, do you have any renew intelligence potions on you, by chance?


Well, I can do this for about another 55 minutes! Before we'd have to sleep before I can do it again!


Oh hey! We were sent here by Delilah Briarwood. You may know her.


Do it. End her. Finish her off.


Wait, am I like being Yoda-carried right now? (All laugh.)


Our boat.


Oh yeah, no problem.


I'm so dextrous.


Let's do hearts.


Dis-ta-peels


I'll take the gum. I'm not proud.


I think so. I think that's all I can do.


Oh. Well, then give it to me.


We don't have much. Many of the things that we carry are very dangerous. Obviously, you have a great deal of genius here. I'm going to show him the elemental shard. I don't know if this would interest you, but I consider it to be of great value.


That went so bad!


So, no. That is a no.


Why? What? Why?


Trickfoots could be legends.


I'm sorry. This part of the thing I wanted to tell all of you at breakfast. The idea is, with some research I've come to find that if anything is in a bag of holding, and the bag of holding itself is destroyed, the items or whatever go into a somewhat void, that cannot be retrieved by any one particular thing. If we are to have our memories erased, as you say, then it would guarantee that when we place the thing in a bag of holding and destroy that bag, it will then be dissipated into that void.


Clever.


I send my Mage Hand out to move the blue banner aside to see if there is anything behind there.


Grog, Grog.


I'll give you the greater. I give him a greater. And Percy. I like it when you turn into the giant cloud thing so you don't have to take a nutshot. Would you like a common or a greater?


Close the door up, run the chain back through, put the lock on it, but don't lock it.


Oh my god. I sleep with it, I put it under my back and it gets all the knots out.


If it was sitting under a foot deep of muck, someone would have found it by now.


Chain!


(laughs) I take my drink back.


I'm going to do a bonus action and I'm going to go air elemental. Full-on, wrath of my people and my hometown, and I'm going to levitate in a cool tornado-y thing.


I reach down, I find a dark stone on the ground, and I go over to the bare side of my face and I draw a very beautiful mustache to complete the other half of it.


Let's all go down the tunnel.


Inside-- tickle, right.


That doesn't matter. It's still in her room.


Describe the two again?


I might not live past this. (fart noise) (laughter)
