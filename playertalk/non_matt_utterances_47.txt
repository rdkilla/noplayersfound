Ooh, shit!


So, hey guess what? It's started.


Taking your pee break now.


Roll. You're a good man.


I pull out my Flametongue dagger and just look in two or three graves. I don't know if there's anything in there.


19 sets.


She took 100 and-- yeah.


Where's Caleb? Caleb?


That was very fun. Thank you for letting me guest and be on the Twitch channel. You guys are a joy to have. I'm so proud to be part of the Geek and Sundry family.


Is there a ring around it?


They could be smarter.


Yeah, but not touching it, scraping it off.


It's a good one. I've been working on it.


21. Again.


13. I believe that hits.


That was a two.


Yep, that's right. Southwest.


Do I get advantage on that?


Do you remember your former owners?


That requires a drink.


Me? Why would I steal your money?


Plus five.


Schmidt, please revolve that staff counter-clockwise please.


Was it a dead human or a dead tiefling or a dead--


I feel like I would've been looking, too, because I was watching for people at the beginning of that.


No, I'm happy for you. As foul as it is. What are you doing? What?


This seems to match up with the tales that my instructor, master Tharendril, told me about back in Syngorn. I wonder if I remember something. If only I had a small polyhedral to roll-- Wow!


Yes. That Crossfit training come in handy.


Are you praying over your swords?


It's sort of a running gag, but it's our name.


Whoa! I pick up the cat and I walk over.


He's invisible, too?! Everyone knows this trick!


I know it's hard. It's deep underground.


We did, he didn't give it.


Maker of kings.


Remove it, put the hand back on. Tea?


Getting better.


23 to hit.


My shield?


Come on, Gunther.


What? I don't even remember being here!


Is there going to be a Critical Role marathon or something coming up soon?


I want straggly, but still a braid. Really nasty, straggly hair.


I go.


You can cut me.


Everywhere is dangerous.


That won't go poorly.


Thank you for that clarification.


I thought the one he left through.


Should I go talk to Melora? Should I go try and recruit Melora? Team Sarenrae and Team Melora?


That brings me to an 11?


Sure. Literally anything is better than a spider, though. For that. I just want to point that out.


(singing) The bears are back in town!


Yeah, the same one I had before that cracked a little.


I'm in smoke. I'm just taking--


Yeah, I just need to be reading.


Aren't they all?


Why do we have to move? We're in the sewers. Who's going to come down here?


Really blitzed on that stuff, it was pretty fun.


Matt, if you were wondering what to get me for my birthday, it's to kill my character in two weeks.


Small question  we checked in as-- you checked in as tieflings.


(laughs) Dotty. D.T. Dotye.


To the front side of the home.


While they were looking at weapons racks and doing stuff like that--


This was the first one we made a clean, positive impact, though. Minimal collateral damage.


That's so sweet.


I think I am going to do a 5th-level Flame Strike.


It's been an hour? My wings then are--


There's been a string of kidnappings there in town.


Actually, that's a good question. How many of us have actually been on a ship before?


All right. Five pounds of gems.


The Frigid Doom.


I was about to say, I know the stats of the Dawnmartyr really well right now, for reasons.


Okay. I will wait for that, then, and I love women.


(whispers) Drop Seeming. Drop it.


Kinda harnessing the moon, you know?


Let's go down, get some food. I'll come with you, 'cause as you said, we're better together. And we'll take it from there. You need some books and stuff, right?


What was I at before? One. I was at one.


We love you, Travis and Laura!


(sighs of relief)


Okay, wait.


I'm going to take my shots. Shot number one. Yeah, as long as I've got reaction I knew what I was doing.


Did she offer to kill a bunch of innocents or anything?


16?


Oh, hey.


Okay, just a little longer then.


Kill everybody.


I know, I feel like it might put you on edge.


Oh, god! Oh, it's the Underdark! Ugh! I'm switching dice. Okay, that's much better.


Now we're going to have to have another huge conversation.


Can we see, well, can Pike, "Can I see into the hovel?"


It's 20 now, yeah.


Do you have any spells slots left?


We also don't know if it's a basilisk.


Scanlan.


Is he this size?


Who? Which one?


Can I see anywhere where there seems to be a crack in the armor and make a--


Second attack. Almost a natural 20, but it wasn't. 13?


Are they all swashbuckling swordsmen like you?


Can you give yourself advantage?


"Which dice will I use? There's no way to choose."


Actually I have a resistance now to psychic damage, so I take 1d6 psychic damage for my gun, not two, correct?


Okay


Oh. Okay. For my last question, can I get a sense on any big evil things that might want to kill us?


To lock them in.


Maybe he can feel you the way you can feel him.


Set that dial back to 39.


You know what? We're going to get downstairs and this key is going to unlock the thing that has the circlet, I know it.


Broke his legs and his heart never woke.


You know what, with my bonus action-- no, just Eldritch Blast. 16?


Of Holding?


Well, I think we should--


That's 23 to hit.


It doesn't say, does it? One minute, or until it takes any damage.


Which one's Tiffany?


He was really, really tough to kill, you guys. If we had been there together, no problem, insta-death.


This place is fucking haunted.


We don't even know where the prison is.


Well, why are you here then? Why did you flee?


So he’s a vampire.


What's reflex? Is that dexterity?


You're just too bad, Vasquez.


Oh, do you need light? (fwoosh)


No thanks. Okay, I'll go back and report what I've heard, or what I've learned.


I had a 16.


Can I use War God's Blessing again?


No. You'll kill yourself!


Basic level Guiding Bolt.


(singing) It's Bigby's Hand! Bigby's Hand. You know it. Shamone.


A tip about a dickhead.


Get angry! Eat angry!


And how long ago was this War of the Beginnings?


Yeah! Hey, Pike and Grog, you guys did an excellent job.


You stole an old blind man's food and money.


-- Klossowski De Rolo the third.


Hey, look, we're killing things! Well, maybe.


Let's go plunder some mines.


Let's go play this game.


Oh no. I wonder if that's a common thing when people get drunk like that.


Would a dragon seek vengeance against one of their brethren killed?


Wink wink, nudge nudge.


Cool. We're not using a random-ass magic trick on an eyeball.


I feel like we should go for the top.


Matching piercings.


(whispers) The city, they're close. (louder) So that is right in front of the keep?


I rolled a two, but it's a 37.


They're a bit hard to make, and they may just not be useful at all, but I thought... I don't know how any of this works.


Pretty sure. I mean, I don't have the best memory or knowledge or brains or really any skills, but I'm pretty sure this was it.


Nine damage, and he doesn't get to move.


Tschüß.


Things are not going well. Have you heard any news of Emon and what has been transpiring there?


Oh, quite, come on over!


I guess just sitting in here for a while.


Yeah. We found out that there's a door.


We're not here to work.


Aw, you beat me to it! No signing it with a kiss.


Intermission.


Ja, that was fine. She's probably a good egg.


It was a lot of meetings. So many damn meetings.


This is you.


How much gold do we have?


You can.


Can I run to the bow of the ship? Heading for a new land.


Not really comfortable with that.


Don't they have harpoon chains?


I have an idea.


Yes, but we could follow them out. We could do the Moneypot. We could run Rat Food. We could do Prince and the Pauper to get it from them. We could try Spider Eyes. Any of those could work--


He destroys nothing except carpets with his pee. Pacific Rim Uprising, tomorrow night, go see it, because I got my tickets.


It's like Ren Faire.


Because only I know it!


Pop pop.


And, as a bonus, I'm going to send some inspiration to Grog.


Keep doing that.


Do I know it's cursed? It's a familiar feeling? From Craven Edge?


Yeah, we're ten-hit-point eels.


Yeah. I think I would like to move to come to Strongcastle's defense over here.


I really like these ones.


Nott, come on, ready? Me and Caleb. One, two, three.


Do you have a one sheet?


You can do the impression, and I will sort through the pages.


And we'll be able to build it back up.


Disadvantage for the?


Number two is 13 points of damage to the second one.


Yeah, we look like we're with them.


Yeah, with the Magician's Judge, could she make her first of two attacks against that one that she's flanking and could she make them reckless?


God, timing.


I'm going to make a bubble around him.


Yes, okay. Let's go.


I feel like he's like flicking off a bunch of trees now. I don't know. He was always an odd one.


You mentioned being able to get us friends and other type of services. Where do you find those resources?


Yeah, Yasha, I mean, do you vomit after you talk to the thunder?


Five-letter words is a big deal!


The drummer?


What was the name of the guy that Grog de-tongued and kicked out the window?


Just if you're fighting-- I just wanted to know if you were fighting the Kryn.


Yeah, I handed all of those bandages to be washed. (laughter)


It's a five.


The door and boxes.


Well, it could be their version of Death Ward.


Maybe one of us. Maybe not all of us.


Can I lean out the window and attack?


I'm little.


Oh. Oh.


Rocks? Hey Keyleth, you should go. There are rocks. You could do something with rocks--


Can we use that all the time, please? Dick in the peanut butter!


Yeah, we were at a Halloween party yesterday. How did you have time for that?


I bamfed out of that probably two minutes before it finished, so I didn't get the tail end, but I got the meat.


That sounds very expensive, I'm not sure that that's possible. Yes, of course I can help you with something like that.


Is there anyone that we can say maybe vouches for us or someone who we are against so that we can win favor with the locals? Something like a no-tail, long-tail binary.


That's not me.


I was thinking more like flavor to my unarmed strikes, but I'm a monk, so?


They go straight down?


Donate, donate.


Wonderful tune.


I hate fish.


It came up the tunnel that was already there?


We're not going to be able to do that.


I'll clean it off. (all laugh)


Same, I'm looking around.


Woah. Really?


Kima was here!


We have to find the prison--


Percy, are you sure it's okay for me to let these people out?


We really need to say stuff, though, because no one's going to be able to understand us. (laughter)


Is my flask done?


Okay. That's good. That's also good. So 14 points of fire damage.


I'm just looking out for you, Nott. I don't want you to--


Who? Him? No, Grog!


d10.


Yes, I approve.


Yeah, we're letting them go first.


What if you get sick of it? You can't empty it out.


We skipped town without paying our inn fees.


Shaun, I--


So much has changed since Lillith was there.


Totally right. The best, finest simple white.


Oh, that's good, that's better than mine, but not much. 23?


No, I'm great. You know, it's interesting, Scanlan being back. Makes me realize that, you know, he's not the only one who keeps secrets.


[bell dangling noises]


I'm sorry I couldn't get it open. I tried, and I made noise, and I should've drunk more, is what I should've done.


Come again?


That's, we got that one already.


Okay, I'm going to run. I'm going to run--


That seems extreme at this moment.


We can see if there are if we Commune With Ducks.


Flipping. I'm just going to keep skimming.


There's your woobie. You can sleep again.


They were ready for us. They knew we were coming.


It's an interesting thing. I think... She just helps when we need her, or when I need her, and I think for the rest of the time, She just -


That was leaning.


Okay, okay. Let me Control Water with the current, and can I redirect the current up and around us to allow us to get in?


Gil, this is on your fucking dice. Natural 20 on the second one.


In the ground or raised or--?


Yes, darling.


Are there people watching the board right now?


Are we in the air?


Lies.


Your parents are Critters?


I reach into my pouch and I take out one of my peas that I got, and I put it on the anvil.


Nope, that does not hit.


There was, actually, yes.


Okie-dokie. That is eight damage.


Question  he'll just keep doing that until I tell him to stop, right?


Everything's fine. You know, we're just weird people right now. It's great.


Can we create white noise?


You want to give it a go?


She would.


Hit it with your staff!


Yes, can you elaborate?


Knew that much.


Oh and Krystina Arielle from Sirens of the Realms.


--bird out and drop me.


I do, but it's not my turn. Or can I take a hit dice at any time?


What of Whitestone?


Though every time we did a little thing, a little of that loot comes out.


Oh, I thought you said it went to the ceiling.


I asked if they would bring him food.


We've got a bunch of dragon pieces.


Yeah man, she's powerful. I will step out again, from behind. And I will try again. But this time I will say, hey, you paralyzed my friend, let's see if you like it! And I'll try to hold her. Hold Person.


Well, if you're ever looking for more customers, you'll always find them in Whitestone. So, if you make your way north.


Okay, I'm going to go ask Claudia.


And it's big enough to fit all of us if we wanted to go.


Oh shit. Yeah. Can I do that?


You're against the wall. I get up. Can I reach around Scanlan, doing another reach around--


Wait, what did you cast?


Ooh, like the T-1000.


If we can make some sort of distraction, to get their attention, and if we can put or heavy hitters, our people up front, we can try and hold them in this mouth, ranged people in the back.


With advantage, right?


I'll be with Jester.


Both of them at me?


Under the water.


Well then I will summon him to stand above me on the box.


I can do this for the future.


And we-- I--


I might. I'm just saying, you're about to buy the ticket and take the ride of a literal fucking lifetime.


I'll hold my action in case I see anything, by the way, with my turn, if that's okay. Oh! Can I move in? I want to move in. I was talking to everybody. Mm-hmm. That's good.


Leave him.


I think we all are, yeah.


And you never come back? He'd be forced to be the one to have to leave the battlefield.


Name check!


And let's go.


Me, too. Grog and Pike were not happy to see him.


So weird.


It's fine, we're gods!


I did, I took it as I went, and then I erased it.


I could watch this all day.


And that was my full movement and everything, wasn't it?


It's totally not toxic.


That's actually a very fair point.


(laughs) Distappeared.


Oh, yay. I had very little, so thank you for that.


All right, I'm on the outside of the bridge.


He dropped that.


Oh, Trinket is still running after her, too.


You've done so much.


All of us are kind of obsessed about checking out the hashtag.


With that symbol on the back.


There's only enough for two other people to take it.


Stay away from black birds for a while.


All right, fuck this. I try and push the door either in and to either side.


So the person that we made a contract with was a devil that ended up being the one that killed Pike, right? That was a devil disguised as a demon?


Oh this game.


Tail or no tail?


Walking at a very gentle pace in that direction.


This is your game, go for it.


But how big? How many?


She's not on the carpet.


Oh. The Phantasmal Force?


I'll bring the specter forward.


And speaking-- speaking of Black Widow!


I want to know why he wants this skull so bad.


You're gone, you're gone. You're chill with me.


Does it look like anybody is looking at us, anybody else in the tavern?


I didn't say anything. I just touched him!


Timothy B. Hudson.


(laughs) Because that's really well done.


Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth?


I can just pop in there and see who's in there and pop out.


Is this my castle?


Yeah, you want to stay away from those miners Scanlan, that's a dirty business.


17 damage.


Not only that, we've, I don't know if word has reached you yet, but in Whitestone we're working towards establishing a Gilmore-themed library for the people with your name attached to it.


Oh, I do. Yes, I will inspire you. I don't know what to sing. What's a boat song?


Yeah, I'm using my 3rd.


Okay... Is there anything you need to know, master?


Having passed the loch before, would we have an idea of what we might anticipate on the way?


Yeah, I'll go.


So, here's what I'm thinking. I mean, we could sneak through here and this one's going to sound like a herd of--


Show me?


There is no end to dick jokes.


They're at your house, the butcher place? Don't worry, we'll take you there. They're being kept safe by a tiny bird with a dagger.


Those could just be vines.


Yeah, can we ask for transparency and information exchange or something like that with these people? So that we can come in and out of the Cloudtop District? Are we cool there?


Kynan! Hey, man! What's up?


Find the Plate of the Dawnmartyr.


I've got time.


I'm the gerbil.


I'm good. After this we'll probably have-- No, I'm good. I mean--


Thanks. You're sure you don't want to just, like, slide one out and just take a look at it?


Or knock on the back door, if such a thing exists.


Yes. I mean, I can heal. I haven't been using any spells-- I can't use anything when your hands are tied.


Oh. Well, all right. The first thing I'm going to do is shoot twice in the face of this asshole.


I think we're going to do that.


Grog can't do anything.


I get about halfway. I fire my crossbow (wailing scream). Fire the crossbow.


Right, yeah. Also, there's got to be an A and B around here. All right, I guess there are more options this way or down deeper.


Oh god. I don't want to get rid of that, that's cute. A vase!


-- makes a constitution saving throw. Okay, these rules are new, so pardon me if I'm a little iffy. So shot with Pepperbox is-- wow, what's wrong with me? 28 to hit.


What about Dan Harmon, just so I can get fired, can we do that? (all laugh)


Cad, can you go with Honda?


We'll finish looting that once we've cut this thing up into little pieces of sushi.


You were very cagey about knowing what it is while we were on break, so I didn't know if this was a thing.


Don't you think that's going to be noticeable?


Maybe you should ask it to go back.


Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful.


You beat me to that by like 0.2346 seconds.


So what are you--


Well, did he drop to his knees?


It wasn't as romantic. It was just a dare.


I've made it really thin like I did before, carved it nice and thin--


I'm going to unleash on this ogre in front of me.


Maybe the cathedral?


It's dark.


No, this could be the spellbook.


Then Slow it? But it doesn't stop, it just slows.


I only had a couple other light things I was going to do anyway.


I don't know. Darts--


Then that's two for you. I'll have two of your strongest whatevers for blond-chin over there.


I think that's actually very impressive, it is actually a process of divination, technically, that's just very--


Are they all kings?


I ask them, how thick does the wall appear to be around that side?


(squeals) I get one, too!


I'm going to keep reading while they head, you guys if you want to--


That's more than what we would've done by far!


You've got advantage!


That's a real place. It's on Ventura.


My Moon-touched sword.


You have no idea how happy I am to see you. Dragon!


Very good. Warm in here.


Yeah, risk it. Because we have to come back through this way, probably.


It's okay. It's not your fault.


No, I felt around in there.


Including the golem?


Charlie! For every spell.


Taking a shot?


Yes, so as she's doing that, I want to pull out the locket and say, actually, Shaun asked me to deliver this to you.


Close enough!


Right. That makes sense.


Whitesly! His last name is Whitesly.


What's a two in German?


How close are we to the cave? Are we still really far away?


Another gold coin goes on the table.


I mean, just don't get sick by having too many pastries.


Not 11, 12.


Yes, I have them, of course. I always, I always have them, they were a gift.


Thank you! Is that how it works?


No, the water--


Right up behind shitface there. And do I have anything left? Or do I just get there and stop.


Can we reach in the SNES, push the game up and down?


Are we all potioned up, are we all--


No, before we get to the intersection.


You can bring dead things back?


Yeah, and I make a Heroes' Feast.


There was also the notice on the King's Hall looking for y'all. I don't know if you knew that, by the way. I imagine a notice in one of these people's houses might mean that they have concern of being found.


Yeah, it saves.


No, not cool!


Wow. I underestimated that whole thing.


I love you, Travis


It is, but we don't have any other--


Is that the Inky Claw Reef?


I'm joking because this has been such a hard day, but Fjord is going to find this very difficult.


Those things!


Okay, I'll throw it.


The Evening Nip, and then they're going to escort us out.


Is this where Dashilla is? Or is she at a different place?


No fucking evil!


That's a 30-something. 30--


I've got a dagger out.


We might want to let them know.


Yeah, 20 feet, you're probably 20 feet.


It just looks like a death trap.


I don't know what I rolled, so I'm going to roll again. 20.


No, you're the leader, I shall accept whatever name--


But then we'll get to see it, and get the drop on it.


Oh wait, I get an advantage.


I would hope not to imagine it.


Lot going on here.


Maybe not out loud say that. Just a thought.


Okay, stay on the road.


He's looking at something. There's something in there!


I'm not trying to grapple him, I'm trying to just push him.


It's like a 23 save, right?


Does she believe it, though?


I know, is it me grinning, or is it dominated Grog? (laughter)


Isn't that like that rakshasa you were talking about?


You remember. Nothing happened. Find Ornna. You didn't see me. You just hid and waited and you didn't know that anything was wrong. If people ask, unless you hear from me, you don't know anything.


I'm going to do a little side by side walking to make it look like he's--


Send the cat.


It is kind of enclosed.


That's what the stories say. One for each color of dragon.


Gives me fire resistance.


I mean, you are dressed like a Faberge egg.


Damn it. Shit hammer.


So good at this. Just a straight check, or a saving throw?


Just looking. 12.


Has there been a raise in criminal activity? Is there something in the town that would start provoking people to want to pickpocket more? Is the rise in the war effort bringing people down? There's got to be some reason.


In the corner, bottom corner.


Okay, I'll come and try to open the door.


Matthew Mercer! You're trying to kill us.


Job postings. Anywhere we might go to--


What, what was it?


He's shitting on a bed somewhere. It's his thing.


I go with Taryon to puke.


It's got to be you, because you're so fast. If you get his attention you can dart out really fast.


Do you have a strong heal?


Would that fit in the bag? Two sets of armor?


I'm staying on our side of the bridge.


Can I get between him and Nott?


I have an extra five feet of movement. 45 speed.


So we find the temple, and then what? I guess, go back to Nicodranas first, yeah?


Is it just hers at advantage, or all attacks against it?


I will fucking yell into my earring if shit goes down, and you guys gotta pray for me.


Wow, that was cocked.


He already took it.


I'm going to head over towards that other ladder really quickly.


From my penis.


Boat shoes? I own boat shoes.


We're just eating breakfast. Go for it!


Yeah, action, bonus action. Done


Is it? (laughter)


Well, here's the thing. I bring the carpet back down and say, I see where it went, if you guys want to fight it. What do you think?


This is something we all do. I don't know why, we don't need to do this. It's just a thing.


You are clever.


No, no, no. I said I'm sleeping with my feet tucked up under me.


No, I don't think I could've.


But it does cost me an inspiration.


The help. Okay, that's good enough for me. I'm in. Will fancy boy be joining us?


And get into "posish."


Kick his ass, sea bass.


I put my foot up!


You are not allowed to-- you know.


I was just going there, damn it! Bangarang!


I thought it would look weird.


39 was the second one.


Against him?


It's the mustache.


I think that's where you're going.


Let's do that, yeah. We'll sneak around the back of the inn, and try to climb up the upstairs window.


I think Hamilton does win on that one.


Vanessa, you're so kind.


I was just saying that it's either that or the library.


Shut up, Grog!


Ja, but I rolled an 18, so it's a 21.


No, don't use magic!


Are we going onto the teleportation pad then?


What's the fence made out of? Is it the spear-y shit?


That's actually not a bad plan.


(muffled) All right, one foot in front of the other. Here we go.


I'm Keyleth.


That is excellent. Also, I'm a big reader. Is there any place that has pulp fiction and shitty smut?


One of us bought warm clothes. (laughter)


Don't be so glum, you old fool.


And we know Westruun.


Do it now, because it's 1,000 feet.


The damage may have--


A whole lot of nothing. I'll go down and watch the show, I guess. I'll watch the training show.


Yeah, because we can eat, too!


I have a pretty high bonus, I don't think I'm proficient in it.


Can I make it if I Step of the Wind?


Time is loosey-goosey. Aren't we playing Dungeons and Dragons here? It's up to him.


Grog, tie him up! And let's get you, do you need--?


I extend my staff and I raise the light just a bit so you can see.


Okay. Let's see if this is-- nope, it's an action because I'm a genius. I'm going to back up. I don't know if that'll do anything. I'm going to disengage and I'm going to back up on my broom.


All right. But I used all my movement. I can't get to it and get her there.


Episode five, what!


Yeah, no, I got it. I got 50 gold of my own.


Consult the book.


Goddamn it. He's probably looking at you, Scanlan. You have the book! We can't lose you! For real!


What is the beacon for?


She also seems very interested in you. And don't get me wrong, she's hot and all, but I question her motives. Feels like she's-- I don't know.


I was just asking. Okay, let's go.


Great great?


I'm going to make you something, nice and useful claw piece, yes.


Yeah, the rest of us.


Scanlan Prime steps up.


I've been meaning to bring something up to you.


One minute, ja. I know. You are again on methamphetamines.


Or the first one would be more engaged with us.


I would like to approach them.


That's a good answer.


All in favor, say aye.


Half-orc.


You're going to hit yourself in the head


He's ragged! Go! If we're ever going to get them, we need to get them now! Lead the way, Percival!


Or you could save that for when one of us becomes a vampire.


I want to know the answer to one someone asked. "How did Travis and Laura meet?"


Yup. I want to train, too. Sit-ups.


I'll leave all his human teeth, I'm not gonna take that shit.


Go play it!


I think you’ll probably have mercy on him, right?


Yeah, I haven't forgotten it now--


On me?!


I don't suppose the other swarms get an attack of opportunity?


That a peach?


I can't make it the cry of a raven-- "such as" is what it says.


I can make so many of these.


Are you getting hit in the head?


On the crossover  Does this mean anything to you?


It's maybe the rise of the justice of the phoenix.


It feels like we should have figured this out.


Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, thank you so much. Two more questions, then I'll leave you alone. One: where can I go get business cards printed up, in this town? It's a calling card? Never mind! Forget it.


And there were really strong people!


We all are dead.


Oh, my name is Caleb Widogast.


She makes it?


Yes, we remember.


If she's spending the money, I'll eat.


You know, it's fine. You get the idea.


I heard "Vex'ahlia." That's ridiculous. Preposterous. Can we go to the videotape? Anyone?


Black Widow is actually one of the first ones I ever got, but they've also got crazy ones-- they've got Devil Dinosaur. That's nuts.


Oh, you were right, Fjord!


That would be hot.


As she gets up, can I just kind of whisper, 'cause he can't hear very well. Wilhand? Can you hear what I'm saying right now? Okay. Is it going to be all right, bringing this up around him?


(groaning) I'm going to pretend to be a small, old platinum dragon.


Okay, so here's the thing. He knows we're here.


That's not how earth works, though. You can't wait down there and then switch back and then think you can grab this.


She's got tricks, though, right?


Yeah! That's no problem. I'm really tough and strong and stuff, so yeah, that sounds fine.


So 100... no, that's just two times in a row.


They're going to be afraid of us.


Well, your wife, but I'm talking about the boss, here.


Cool! Great!


What's going on? You were arrested? Why?


I look at him and I ask, this? My sisters, they are responsible for this?


Yes! (laughter)


I'm trying to make sure that if someone tries to come in our room we'll know if they come in.


He wouldn't be able to get a firm grip on the swing, it'd be like.


What's today? What day is it?


On this, for with my Friends?


No, not 27, 24.


Yes! D&D Beyond is our awesome sponsor. It's a great online mobile access thing that you can manage all sorts of stuff. I'm losing my voice tonight, because--


You have three points left.


Eight. I'm rolling poop on initiative.


I'm sweating.


Like Grog?


I'm climbing up.


You're going to be very good at this.


Oh, we did a long rest-y?


Sylvan?


There's big people. There's little people.


(whispering) Clues.


I made it outside.


Seems too complicated.


All right, fine. I'll do it.


Illustrate all the things that could happen.


That's a pretty good deal.


16. That's 23 plus... 30 damage. Radiant damage. (lightning noise)


Oh, wait, did you get the final blow in the rakshasa in the Slayer's Take?


Explosive arrow!


Yeah, glad I came here instead of going to the award show. Totally worth it. But we won a Geekie. So, I thought I should say that.


I don't think it can be destroyed. But maybe it can be put far away.


When the moment is right.


Whoa. That was easier than I thought.


You totally should!


(burps loudly)


Duncan! That was his name! Right, the guy that you drank across?


Yeah, exactly. That is 20.


Frumpkin saw all of this, yeah? Saw the doors, all of that? I'm going to creep my way to the front door and as I go, I'm going to cast Detect Magic.


It's the fastest model yet! I love Harry Potter.


It's time for me to draw.


Dee Bradley Baker! (laughter)


Oh, shit balls.


You can ride the bear.


Hoomanism.


Okay that's a 29 to hit.


Oh my god, it's Allura and Kima.


(count quietly)


Okay, so 18.


Yeah, we could. But not town, we were told to stay in town.


Yes. That is-- what is that, a bite attack?


You need any help? Backup?


No, the more distance that we keep, the better.


Really? We're just starting to climb our way up through this thing.


You're coming?


On the tombstones that are around, do I recognize any of the language, or can I tell how old some of these gravesites are?


When she peeked-- I'm asking Keyleth, but you might need to come in here with detail. When you peeked in at Hotis, what-- Like, how much security was around him. What was around him?


(yelps) Sorry!


We've got a couple more days, too.


I was really hoping you would have houses of mushrooms. Do you have any?


Beyond the wall?


Well, I don't know.


Oh, is there a fireplace?


We know a kitten has one hit point. Wait, five? Two hit points? A kitten's worth? A kitten's worth of hit points.


I think for me, too. I've had more people throw rocks at me than conversations, and it's nice. You know what, it's nice with them, too. They don't seem to mind that, you know, my teeth are a little-- People find that off-putting, sometimes.


Are any of the weapons that we found better than my handaxe?


And now you're looking for the next sign.


Who lives in the third house?


That was a new level.


Spellcasters suck!


Do you have wine and ale at the breakfast buffet?


She could have gone skiing and just gotten a sunburn here, like this.


Well, for anyone who has been asking  I am okay. I did not leap off the cliff out of some weird parallel allegory.


Very Lucky Charms.


And if he's successfully thrown, I just cover his mouth and grab the back of his head and squeeze.


An act?


Yep. This place is weird. I did grab the debate book.


Oh, Kima.


What about the earth elemental thing that you were going to do? Can you still do that and tunnel with that?


At all.


Maybe, Yasha, you can intimidate her with your girth and darkness.


What? But that was a cool spell!


Do we need a carriage? We have a stable full of horses.


Well he is very large, and we won't talk about that area. I have seen it, but let's not talk about that either.


Hey! You got that big fucking turtle you wanted!


I'm using all my 20s here. 12, shit!


It's not a saving throw. Oh well, that's fine. That's a 16.


I don't think we destroyed the god.


If we get two in, he has a 50-50 shot.


Is Vex down?


Oxygen's good, although if we have something to help with poison, that might be good. Can we get some antidotes?


We have a cat.


(singing) Thunderstruck!


I'm going to set you down now.


It looks great.


Uh, Vex.


I know she's drunk, but--


Uh, 19.


I do. 12th Man. Woo!


Don't fuck me, Gil. Ooh, that's not great. I'm going to go ahead and roll my inspiration. That's better.


All right, that's 22. 22! Sorry, 22 hits?


Was there anyone new here recently that you haven't worked with a lot?


How about the one that I stole from her?


Reckless, great weapon, all the shit. Goddamn, that was two 19s in a row. If I'd picked that other thing, they would have been criticals. 28.


d10s. Here's one.


The Take's not coming out. There's no money in your bodies.


The eight that came out when I did it the first time.


I'm at four hit points! You go fuck yourself.


I can't do it. I'll just take damage. I'm already low.


(whispers) I do have a couple things left on my to-do list though, okay? (laughter)


This is really good all to know. Now we're getting all this information.


Vex'ahlia, you know the Underdark. Are there any critters crawling around in that pit?


What, hang on, Grog. You were--


There's two figures on a boat about a hundred yards out.


Yes, it's private property.


And that is 20-something, which hits.


I'm the worst.


I don't think so. I mean, you're the holiest person in this city.


Can I insight check her to see if she's telling the truth?


Well, no, he's said another, aside from Thordak.


That's very maternal.


100 miles. There's only so many roads that lead out of the city. I'm pulling out a map and I'm marking any roadside tavern that's within 100 miles of the city.


Oh, cover my nips.


You are both doing it together.


That's fine, and then that one. Bam. And then let's go. Can I go four, and then--


Don't waste all your spells, you've got to fight fish men!


Did I find any potions? Did I find anything?


Taliesin is my mother's name, please. No.


You're not leaving here without telling us the truth!


I'm going to use a bonus action to look over my shoulder and see everyone that I know. I'm going to see my sister and her husband. I'm going to see the woman that I love. I'm going to see Grog. I'm going to see Arkhan. I'm going to see my friend Scanlan. And then I'm going to dig into Vecna's eye and stab away.


They knocked her unconscious.


If that's what you want to do, then yeah!


(Pumat Sol voice) Take advantage. I made a--


I dabbled... No, I talked about it. It always just seemed so impractical. And now I'm looking at one, and I'm irritated.


Me? Okay. I'm gonna look for traps. Eight, plus five. 13.


Bright and early, Anime Weekend Atlanta. We're there Friday, Saturday, Sunday, come down, see us and throw things in our face. That'd be great.


The shaft is.


(singing) Hide your kids! Hide your wife!


Working hands, farmers.


Let's make it work.


I know, Grog!


Are we going to try and separate these two? Is that the plan?


He was, and is, but we're just never home.


Censored video game blood.


I think we're good to go back and join the others, yeah.


You just have a Trapper-Keeper full of appointments?


That's weird. Do we press ahead?


What did you just say?


We could use a little help down here!


Yeah, I'm doing that anyway. I'm going to move back towards the corner where I was going.


I was envisioning a big, evil monster.


My fighter ability thing, which is 1d10 plus 12, so that's 18 points of damage back.


We come for an audience with many people, to be honest. We are looking at many avenues of possible help. Contacts, trade, anything that can help us in our time of dire need.


Constitution save?


But you can make the illusion of a head talking.


No. We tried-- That's dangerous work and it'll usually backfire. No interest in that. It's mostly just trying to help people get their shit together. Did someone send you on the wrong path?


This is really cool. Oh god, it's huge! Grog! Little baby bulette.


Oh? Good. So I've got advantage because the smoke demon hasn't gone yet, so dagger and a dagger. First one is, that's 29, and the second one is a 24, so 29 and 24.


Well, you were revived, from death.


I'm conflicted here. I did give this to you--


By all means.


You done been woked.


Seven more points of damage.


Not the whole time, but for much of it. I didn't know if I could talk to you all.


And then the last dagger, the keen dagger, stabs him in the butt again, and that is--


I take a good long look at it.


Towards the three carts?


Oh, the stealthy thing, yes, thank you so much, I'll accept it.


Like Star Wars, just hold it until it's over.


I bet that hits.


I turn into Minxie and resign to the idea that I'm going to be sleeping with Garmelie and Trinket and just cuddle next to them in Minxie mode.


Those zeroes look so good.


She takes bribes. She's a corrupt politician.


Listen, the anchor needs to be you, Nott. You're our ringer.


Certainly. Your turn to block mine!


We are versatile as shit.


(as Caduceus) That was interesting. That was really great.


Oh, you haven't done it yet. Never mind.


All right, we stop and let Pike down.


It takes a little shock, though.


I'll leave that to Laura in a couple months.


Not all of us are lucky enough to have a lineage in a name.


(sighs) Nine.


She's fine. She's fine!


One man doing it all.


So, whichever direction it is, that's the way we'll head.


No no, we need to get a-- we need to eat.


Shit, my insight's balls-- Five.


Some of the stuff I didn't see, some of the stuff Taliesin didn't see. So we're not completely spoiled, we're a little spoiled.


Yes, let's.


House rule.


It's bigger than sin, isn't it?


Okay. That's something.


(gulping) I'm having a little.


You know they have the dubbed version of the alien language on the DVD?


The light appears ever-present. Strange.


Sleep well with your bad decisions.


Except we get Trinket.


No! They're cursed.


I'll move towards him. Oh, then I see a crazy thing in front of me. Shit. So I probably take a couple steps back. (laughter)


Very valid question.


Eating my mechanical pencil. (laughter)


All right. Good to know.


And now I try to blind him.


I'm going to try and calm the crew a little bit.


This is where we send an owl.


Yes, I rolled an eight.


What's the bridge made of? Is it just rope and wood?


I take 50 gold of what I have left and I leave it with him, and I take out three daggers. I can hear my sister's voice in the back of my head. I want to use insight on him to make sure he's trustworthy. Oh, that's good. That's 20.


I know that your life has built up to this moment in many respects. But your father is very proud of you. You've already done a lot. You silenced that dragon. You've done a lot.


I'd rather be a free agent on this one. I'm not here to fight on water.


Really? And they're still alive? Weren't killed in some crazy raid, or... eaten by dragons or...fell in a pit of lava?


Sure. Maybe some accounts of the Myriad.


Well, if you used her right name.


Yeah, unless we see any kind of potion shops here.


I've seen her regrow a foot. It's amazing.


But you don't know jokes?


Yeah, but it's hideous. And they said they didn't do it very well.


Could you have added inspiration dice to that?


How often can you re-up that jar? Oh god, it's nasty water.


They're friend-pets.


Suspended by octopi.


Lead the way, Jester!


Does it hurt us to get near it?


I was misinformed.


Why do you want me to die?


Off to the side. Park it away from the other boat.


Or we could just drink. We know who the fucker was. We know who he's going back to.


Shouldn't we get out of the swamp first? What if there are scaries around?


This is a guy, it is a male ogre?


Is it a negative d4?


Matt's wood.


(dissenting grunt)


It's fine, you can be honest.


Get back in there, Rocky!


Oh, a 20. Aw! 17, okay. Plus my stealth, which is five.


Just an extra night of torture, it's no big deal.


So, Clarota's with us?


Female elven, or is this female--


You would be dust.


So how much bigger is Vorugal, like is he--?


Does that happen when you think really hard?


There is a shop here!


I was there for five seconds. I put Taryon's armor under the bed and then I left. I was in there for 30 seconds. I don't have any dogs. I don't know dogs.


So I only get two.


Under the moonlight.


Eight. Eight.


Didn't you roll an eight?


I don't know what she is making?


I feel like we just passed into performance art, there.


No, I rolled three.


You can't get away from me.


I say  Hey guys! Cruises are really trashy! (laughs)


Give me that ruby. (ting) I catch it. Water elemental seems appropriate based on our knowledge, yeah? Water elemental. And Planar Binding. And I talk to him in my elemental speech, which I can do.


(creepy voice) I'll swallow your soul!


How much were necrotic?


I'm going to pull Hex up on myself.


We're going to go up in a tree. Let's go 200 feet away.


It sounds like the Abyssal ones are the ones that you have to do.


That's better. 17 on the second.


Wow, you know that?


I don't know, you detected--


And the Death Knight.


Do you know who implemented that rule?


No, they go up to 25.


I am-- I stand by what I said before, I think we should let them go out and fight a dragon, and we try to rescue the city while they are distracted.


Not stone?


I'm thinking of a number between one and three.


And finally, Liam prepared an old Irish blessing!


Well, maybe it wasn't publicized. Maybe it's a surprise drop-in show.


Yeah, but as they walk away I want to look at the fucking cage and really get a good look at what they had.


We all do.


Yes, as in silence noise.


I think that was already there, yeah.


I'm rusty on my rules. That should've been a 17.


Smartypants.


Are we really doing this now?


He's Huge!


I will.


He actually can take that much damage, though.


It's filled with things from nature that I find significant.


Okay. Thanks for letting me know. Fist bump.


Taylor!


Oh, this one has a little bit missing? How much? Because this is less than it normally is.


Wow, so you said the Greyspines own this one?


Not JB?


God damn it. Fuck it, if you're in with Lorenzo, I'm going for Lorenzo.


Does this helmet look like it's something that didn't cost a shit ton of money?


Totally. He was dead a second ago. Now he's alive.


Scanlan, 26.


Oh, because he failed?


Yeah, we got 1st-level Lay on Hands to get her up.


I mean, I know you can two-day ship any type of--


Tuck it behind my ear for later.


I slap him in the face.


You don't recognize us, it's not safe to walk these streets for outsiders, so we were using a little bit of trickery. This is us. We're the same people you were dealing with before.


We've got two more rivers, right?


Spoiler!


Can I do a check on the potion since I've got alchemy training?


I'm going to cast it onto Vex.


Is that your real name?


Well, the campaign goes on for another-- I can't believe you just fucking did that.


Oh, fudge.


Oh! [shouts and jeers]


Hold on. I rolled a three.


No, it was just his whip.


Middle-rear.


"Can you read my mind?" (all laugh)


All right. But how do we shake the uards-gay?


Now that I know your tricks.


Fireball! Wand of Fireball.


It's stone. Could you open the floor and let them fall?


It's not! Oh, well then--


Either that, or they think that I'm a Xhorhasian assassin, and I am not.


I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be okay.


Maybe it's a trap. Maybe it's definitely a trap.


No, I'm just waiting for Nott to throwing it back at them, yeah?


I think we should keep the giant as a distraction.


Levitate would make her quiet, yeah.


Wait, it's not a two!


She's just the biggest. I'm going to stand next to the biggest person.


"Matthew Mercer is why I will DM so I should help out."


You can leave. You can go back to where you came from. I protect this forest now. This is mine.


What are you laughing at?


That's it, that's all you need?


Well, that's going off of a snake speed.


I just talked to Vex, and she said that maybe if something were to happen tomorrow, maybe it would be better to just say some things, so that you're not, you know, thinking about it if somebody dies.


I pass 150 gold.


Aw buddy.


They're all like no magic and stuff here.


What does our room look like? What does our stuff look like? Is it ruined?


I wasn't the torturer. I was the torturer's assistant.


You have seen it before?


Thank you. I'm going to Cure Wounds.


Keyleth's right up against that elemental in front of her, right? I'm going to run right behind her--


Did he see you, does he know who you are?


Pretty much have it memorized at this point.


We traveled into the fucking nine hells to get Pike a set of armor. We went and battled a city of vampires so Percy could feel good about his name. We fought goliaths for Grog. We've traveled across planes of existence so you could fix your fucking daddy issues. But you've never done anything for me. Ever! You've never risked anything, you don't know me, you don't know anything about me. What's my mother's name? What's her name? Easy question. Died in front of me. Killed by a goblin. Biggest part of my life. What's her name? My father. Is he alive or dead? How old am I? Where's my fucking dog?


I rolled a 19 for Buch.


We're going to stealth, right? Because I just cast it on all of us.


Ooh, I will never say no to enhancement.


It just happened?! Like that?


We'll just go to Home Depot and get some trammels.


Just you wait, Travis Willingham! The chickens are all coming home to roost!


Don't say the W word!


Can we remember? I have advantage to recall information.


I stick my two fingers inside of his nose, crank back on his nose, reach in, and rip his tongue out of his mouth.


Um. Percival?


Ooh! Like starting a fire. (blows air) Go, go! Can I Druidcraft? Come on!


Is the lake within the city limits?


Yes. Sorry, Matt. I know we're trying to get to other things, but magic compels me to put on my best silk g-string, and it compels me to use the series of tunnels that interconnect all of the rooms.


Table and Table.


Is there anyone who can send me to Syngorn?


Episode title!


I give a nod back.


I should have given him Blessing of the Trickster. Oh no!


I've made a terrible mistake.


We can take him up up up, and just drop him.


Simple stone. (all laugh)


Did she walk away from me, by the way?


Oh. Sure.


I thought I was after Vax?


It takes her a day to learn that and she can only do it like once or twice at the most.


Okay, I call him back.


Yeah, like how pretty they are.


Tongue. I'll also take that natural 20.


Am I something? Or is it just dicks?


Caleb, can you do that, too?


Find a bar!


Oh shit, okay. To RP my tragic one on the first fucking battle a little bit, I'll turn to everybody and go, guys, no, it's part of the show. Molly said that people die. She was just a claque. Okay. And then I run and I'm going to tackle the zombie guy. Can I see if I can grapple him?


Guys need any help?


He yelled a lot. Then we ran off in separate directions, and I've been running ever since.


Let's go this way and then circle back.


All right, I think I have one.


This is deep Texan, I don't know--


Wait, but are you going to hurt us?


Okay. Oh my god, I'm shaking so bad. I will start casting Revivify, and I will hold my turn until Scanlan bamfs us.


Anything to get you out of the wine cellar is such a good idea.


So that's where you're from? Xhorhas?


It went well. I think we found suitable passage for you out of this city. Needless to say, without involving you too much, we're going to have someone take you out a secret entrance and make sure you're safe on your way out.


Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, speaking Draconic again. Percy.


Which we have advantage on, right?


Can you disarm the traps so you don't keep just setting them off?


Do you want us to?


Oh no. You're still...


(gasps) I wonder if we could send fire into the caves where they've burrowed?


Crackers, all around.


Then do it!


How about we casually make our way over, and as we're doing that we can keep an eye out for kingsguard and see if they know of this guy?


All right. Wait for three more minutes and then go.


"If you lift me up, I could see the ones above the door!"


This is Trinket.


Yeah, it's a sewer nexus with a beast with webs.


Yes. Yes, just stay. It's fine.


"Listen, that's the game, suck it up!"


There's a lot you can do when you're falling!


Yeah, we're going to stick down, and just pull.


Oh, that's better for you, ten for you.


I know. She'll be safe.


Okay, never mind, I don't cast it.


We're here to save you! Oh god! Block his arrow for me!


I have a giant pile of stuff in the other room


-- and then I bring it up, while I tell them all that stuff.


Yeah, because they'll go through real fast.


I'm looking for my dad.


I just wanted to send him to the entrance.


We've got to cut down this tree.


I'm so scared right now. (all laugh)


Oh, between the two. So it is out, door, hallway?


That guard. He said our contacts were right. Our informant was correct. Somebody is informing on us. It could be you.


Ew! Like the poop splatter!


I know. I'm well aware.


That's cheating.


Hey, maybe?


Oh, I'm fine with it. I'm fine with my trust fund, because my parents are dead, yay.


I am helming the damn magic carpet, of course.


Jesus. (laughter)


It's our fucking business, you know?


Dice are doubled, too? The weapon's within five feet.


I'm going to keep my Stoneskin up.


I'm going to be bringing in a bag of Bazooka Joe comics, from the gum.


It's hard to find good help these days.


Okay. I'm going to run over and try and collapse the sail. So it's not unfurled, try and collapse it? I don't know if that's the right call.


It's one on the wall, yeah?


And that's a 14.


That's pretty dope.


Look at that honor code!


Simon 2.


Haste?! (gasps)


Yeah, you'll have to pick it up. I can't even lift this thing.


And that hits.


Yeah, please me too.


So plus seven. It's a six. No, it was nine. 16.


Do you know how, at the first tree, an apricot was picked and things shook, something happened there. This place was all about drei, the number three, so you want to go pluck another fruit and that's two out of three and what happens once the third--


Oh, there's some stuff in the store!


You have five seconds to come up with a better fucking plan, or I am doing it.


I don't want any mead; I just want the honey.


Yeah, kill him a lot for what he's about to do!


Did it break?


Dairon?


That's amazing. Are we going to blow up the ship?


Let's go down at the same time.


Can we get this guy drunk, please.


It feels like someone was raptured, and we're stealing their stuff. That's what it feels like.


That's playing--


No, I did not see a vision. I saw a burning person.


I was seeing if we were in Gilmore's room, that's all.


I feel like I was told as a child not to put things in my ears, but I guess I'm doing this.


I think we're trying to save the world at this point.


I imagine.


Great. I'll take that whatever it's called.


We don't know if she's unconscious or dead?


I plan to go see Earthbreaker Groon.


Okay, good. Just keeping you on your toes, mate.


Well then, yeah.


That's my woobie.


Be on guard.


How about 400 even, and you can direct me to some ore, as well?


I do, but still. Four.


Amazing. Okay. That's good. That's 25 to hit?


Boom.


You haven't come this far.


I thought that was a gimme-- oh, that's the bonus action?


Keep going down. Down, down, down.


Is that it? That's it? We will destroy everything we touch? We will cause more harm than good? We will carve a path of destruction and make it seem like we're doing good, and then people will worship us because they think we're heroes, when in the back of my head I'm thinking about all the death that has come by our hands?


He wants the claw to be cooler than that lady's claw hand.


Just google it.


But she's got the basilisk blood in her eyes.


We're in the cellar, that's why I went to the cellar.


Oh my god, getting his arms off him, brilliant.


He's grappled.


Yes! 11 plus-- All right. 12. Great.


All right, I'll take the other 50-foot section of rope and I'll start wading into the water, and I'll take a swim back the way I went.


Sure. I'll just pull out my rod, grip it hard, choke down on it, maybe grip it with my left hand so it feels different-- (laughter)


You want me to do this, yeah? So I should take my hair--


Yeah, against them both!


We don't have to, I mean--


I charge my decanter. That's my turn.


I don't believe so.


Brick bray!


Unless anyone's doing something terrible, or going somewhere they really shouldn't.


Oh no, how do we get it off?


I mean, if we die, does it matter?


Shush, yeah, it does smell bad. Scanlan gave me some patchouli to rub on it, but it only does half the job. What can you tell me about it? It belonged to a god.


It's just, I trust you. I feel like I know you. You know we had that thing back there and then Keyleth was yelling at you. What was that all about?


Now, hold on. Did you steal anything while you were in there?


Mugging down in the alleyway.


I give her a little (clicks tongue) when I walk by.


You're holding back. Divine Sense. The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor.


Okay. Now that I know this is not who I thought it was, I am going to rage. I would like to rage, and in that rage, I'm going to unfurl my wings.


(drinking noises)


You're all gonna see it.


Should we make a distraction or anything?


There is water in the, was there groundwater of some kind?


Yeah, I think that will be very valuable when the time comes.


Do I still get a bonus action?


Okay, see you guys later!


Can I do a quick scan and see if I see more?


Oh, in addition to the wish? Oh.


Yeah that's wunderbar.


Don't talk about titties!


So technically, Lady Kima, we might be able to get back in eventually and get your weapon.


I'm going to duck. I'm going to step back from from the edge, just so that I'm not in its eyeline for a little bit. I'm going to catch a breather.


Give me that sweet whisper!


Do you want me to carry it for you?


Whoa. Hey, Stubby. Wake up.


(announcer voice) Ophelia Mardun. (laughter)


Fucking shit. 17.


Seven points. Healing.


We're Yasha's booker. It's like her agency.


I don't have to use a move action right now. I can, like, look at him.


Your chances of succeeding here alone are pretty fucking slim. And if you want us all to work with you, you can't go from door to door, bringing wrath and ruin the way you just did, or you won't have our assistance. Not all of us.


Straight there.


You did very well and there are other things that we should think about purchasing.


(Gasps)


Here’s ten platinum.


Yeah, I think so. Yeah.


Get that book.


That would have worked if someone had been a little snappier with the Thaumaturgy.


We're a circus! Of course we've robbed people! My god, we have robbed, swindled, we've been robbed, we've gone back and found the people who've robbed them, sometimes we don't! Oh my god, yes.


Scanlan. Scanlan.


Please fail.


Bamfing?


And think how useful that will come in the bedroom. Manacles! Nobody? Cool.


Well, that's a topic for the group. We're staying in an inn where there was a dead person.


So my thought, right? Is that I think we have to be arrested. Breaking into a prison seems real tough. At least with this guy's plan, if he's lying, the worst we get is just straight-up arrested, which I would assume means all our toys get confiscated, right?


Is that including your brother?


You mean a dick?


Darn it.


She's bonafide.


Oh, boy. 19. Naturally.


This is the holy light swirling in a ball before it takes off.


Are you serious? (gasps) What?


We're in this with you until this end.


High five it.


Natural one!


She looks at him like a skeleton key; she needs him for what she wants.


The last one was too, which is why I just scrubbed it.


Do we want to do that instead?


No! I come out, because you're taking too long.


I've got Garmelie.


Well, yeah.


Before we go. I am dropping a giant mouse in there, right?


I have no-- it's holding me, I don't think I can be like--


Matt, real quick.


I can, I can cast Anti-Life Shell on us. Then we can haul ass really fast.


Yeah, great.


That was the same one each time. 28.


I don't know if that's going to help.


Up to six miles.


Exactly. It's on the RSVP.


The Mistress Delilah. Where is she right now?


Of course, I know everything about royalty.


I'm freaking out! I don't know what to do!


And that's our choice.


When you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist.


Wouldn't that nullify that? Three-quarter cover means nothing. It's just full cover.


Are there any drains on the floor as we walk around?


We did-- we could--


I'm trying really hard to lift this pipe with my scrawny little arms.


I'm pouncy. And I come out into the hallway.


Right, listen. I was going to pounce on this poor farmer over here, but I saw you were obviously keeping your eye on him. Why are you doing that?


Yes absolutely.


It's an arcane thing though, right?


Toya's there too.


I can do that. I can do that.


Oh. Gas.


One of them out of his hand. The one that doesn't auto-return.


It is, it's a stinky-- but that was Caleb, I think.


I'm going to stand by Caleb, actually.


I'm going to buy it a steak and I'm going to--


And what, go with Jarett? Not Jarett, Asum.


I know! But I didn't think anybody was going to do it, really!


So what's the plan here, guys?


Yeah. My second attack against the guardian. 16?


Action surge!


I'm organizing my dice right now! 19!


I earned it.


We're drawing them out, and then once we know their position, I guess we'll just run and gun?


You're welcome, boo.


Oh, where'd you get this?


We'll all go together.


Do I get to inspire myself on the save?


And fuck us for not asking. (sniffs)


21-- 22.


Hey, but you're thrifty. You're good.


Scanlan One turns to Scanlan Two and sings a Song of Healing.


It's-- you're in slow-mo!


Sorry. More announcements, guys!


Just pumped a 1st-level Divine Smite, and that's going to be 21 plus three is 24, 24--


It was, yeah. But on the outskirts.


You look so great in that hat! Where did you get this hat?


Yeah, 15 for him.


Are we back, are we on?


I didn’t even - no no no, do it the real way, man. I don’t want any mulligans.


Yeah, I mean, in the backyard we have a pretty large tree.


Oh, let me see what my constitution bonus is. Oh, it's nothing.


I'm back in the chest of the titan? Does it look familiar? Do I remember?


Percy, you've been riding Raishan! Die, evil witch!


Yeah. Or like one of those tiles you put on your keys.


I'm sure she had gloves on. You had gloves on, right?


Oh, so you can listen to it in the morning and watch it live at night. If you have a lot of free time. Or a really long drive, maybe.


When in doubt.


Vax was very curious to see what a gnome looked like naked.


Do you want some Goodberries? It might help a little bit--


Yeah! Now, is there a long history of distinguished tour leaders before me?


True colors, (singing) shining through! (laughter)


We've got to go.


Pike, do you know anything about Vecna?


Maybe... well...


Turf? Astro-turf?


Yeah, and my headdress is a little wonky.


Yeah, I guess we came back to the group and told them about what's going on.


That's code. Yes?


Could you un-Polymorph your tripod, for god's sake?


18 and 10? Because of your--


So that's Shapechange, right?


(hollow metal knocking sounds)


Boat shoes!


After!


Even with these gods, there is still much doubt as to our success. We are not certain. We are not sure.


What do we want to do?


Hey, Keyleth? While we're flying through the air, is it possible for you to give us a nice inspiring speech?


Tiberius, hit us.


They'll know how to get back.


Let's go back to your temple.


I take his face and I push him down on the ground.


It is an April Fools' joke.


Maybe. I don't know. Do you have like a pamphlet or something?


One Dwarf Too Many.


It couldn't just be ash from the thing that is burning?


We leave at dawn?


C'mon, pull your weight, man!


I think it's the funniest thing I've ever seen. (all laugh)


Okay. I love you. So yeah, there will be a Wednesday Club. Check out Twitter for updates, but I'll be back and it will be fun, and I'll be catching up on all my books.


Anything of interest?


Masked.


Well, this is just very-- this is is a very egg-on-face situation.


I mean, there's that.


I grab her and bring her back. No, I'm just kidding.


I mean, it's a normal amount of time.


Not the dragon. Although, probably the dragon too.


Yeah, come on now!


No, is it a bonus action?


Maybe you could pop him over then? Just for a little bit.


Props to that set, though.


Did his feet come off the ground?


Something is missing here.


Plus, if this is as aggressive as they say it is, an attack on the border, I'm sure that legionnaire's job will be there when we return anyway. Price might have increased.


Oh, Scanlan! I run over and I start pulling the vines off of him. Holy shit, Scanlan, I'm so sorry. Thank you for healing me.


(muffled) Fort Worth, Texas?


Well, we can't all fit on the carpet.


I know! Don't be sad bear, be happy bear!


I'm going to cast step of the wind-- Sorry, not cast it. I'm going to use a ki point. I'm going to take a breath, gather my chi. Along the edge of the branch anime run--


He was really pissed off.


So soon! Which one?


I don't know why I did that.


They come back, man. First is 26. Second is a 17, but I'm going to use my second Luck, so the second is a 21. And the third is 19.


Hey, Ornna?


It's fine here, it's fine.


I'm going to throw my weapons in the river. Hold on, I'll be right back.


That's pretty crazy. So you think you can actually-- hang on, why do you want to live with your dad that you never met? Why not just go do your own thing?


I cast Friends on him.


I'm so excited for you!


He’s covered in hooked armor and running at us aggressively.


Caleb, you have things that you wanted to accomplish to the north, right?


Like, the hole that was already created by Scanlan's Fireball?


Wait, what are you doing, what are you doing?


Whoa, that's really low.


Okay. I'm gonna drag him closer in. I wanna drag-- send him this way. [no audio]


Well, speak for yourself.


We'll tell your story, Grog.


He's still in melee? Okay.


While they're figuring it out, on one of the days can I make my way by Ren Sutan's physician's office?


So everything's fine at the keep?


I mean, unless anyone else has anything to say?


Um, I thought--


You want me to cure him of poison?


With the party treasury? Oh, sure.


(Grog voice) I would like to run.


Maybe in a game. Maybe not.


I think you should.


(whispering) I've seen him before.


It depends on what you want to offer us as the Victories of the Victory Pit.


Especially if there is no bowl in the safe house. Then we know some other place to look for it.


I'm going to trigger the Luck right now.


Oh, that's okay. You can give her all the gold that she needs to buy new things for the kitchen.


Can I get my handaxe back?


A million. 24.


Did he give back to us or did he not?


You know what, I'm going to tie this to the arrow. It's going to give it really good luck.


What's his purpose?


In Draconic  we apologize for waking you up. Unfortunately, I sent my brother here before with our compatriot, and he spoke out of turn. We're actually planning the attack the day after tomorrow.


Look, I know that was hard for you.


And where's the green dragon.


Once we get to the mansion, Shale will bid the group farewell and head down to Westruun to let the rest of the Herd know what's happened, about the great triumph of the bearded king.


Yes, it is. Sorry.


Okay, I'm going to do what I originally planned which is to make the hole not look like a perfect hole. To make it look like the planks broke or something?


That's a bunch of stank.


Okay, I lied. I drop my elemental form. I go ahead and I'm going to cast Gust of Wind ahead of us to try and make a tunnel and try and air this heat down.


You already are.


Are you flirting with it?


You're throwing a meatball past a lion that's stalking you.


That's good living, Taryon.


Oh, it took a few minutes, didn't it?


Okay, I need ten minutes. Ten minutes with this thing. I'm going to, as a ritual spell, cast Identify.


Sovereign?


Which I have advantage.


Her!


A tome that increases your dexterity plus one.


Oh man. I can find all sorts of problems with a situation if I look hard enough.


He can tell your fortune!


Okay. (incoherent mumbling)


Saddle up your doggies, hee-haw.


Huh? Oh, first, because--


She's that girl.


We all go underwater with Nott.


And I sit down and I open the book.


Okay, this sword, because I know you're all dying to know, is very old. It is a greatsword. Would I know the name of it by casting this?


I'm going to find Fjord and make sure that however I throw up, it makes it so it looks like he did it to himself. (groaning)


High Warden Tyrelda.


And you say she sits in a room by herself eating pastries?


If we find it, though, and we go down there-- we can't go down there. Can we go down there?


Moonbeam staff.


Lasts about an hour. (laughter)


I'll search for a keyhole while we're at it.


I thought you wanted a distraction!


Getting each other ready.


I'm going to sing-- Oh well, that's fine, that's fine.


28.


So we could just forge another one!


Do I see anything? As I'm doing this, yeah, if I'm looking at it.


At least ten.


Yeah, right? What's that? What is that?


Dragon blood for fucking days.


Nope, that's not what I was going to do. Fuck, I'm so sorry you guys. Where's my--


Is there another rowboat for us?


(gasps) You didn't put some of that stuff in, did you?


Enough about the pastries already.


Able to be healed.


Because that's my strength.


Oh, the cub is Trinket.


Just to the door.


Next month?


Cha-cha slide.


I'm right where I want to be. I want a 45-minute walk to get there.


For business dealings.


Yes, he's puffy pants.


Let's give it a go. There's a first time for everything.


Okay, so 22.


Sure. Eight.


Ready? One, two, three.


You too. I'm sorry.


To see if there's a trigger to stop all the traps?


Chop off her whole arm.


Oh hello, I wasn't expecting you.


I'm going to join the women up top.


Well, I don't just want to destroy it.


That's why mine didn't happen, either.


Circle at the top and wait for my command!


I am a backpack right now.


"Oh, he missed you with advantage? Yeah! He misses you! What's his AC? 12? He misses you!"


Fjord, do you think it is safe to send in some light with him?


And Grog's just content sitting over here completely blank.


Yup. Yeah.


I'm in the chat right now.


I guess behind Grog.


Well, you know, you're very appealing.


The lion heads. Do they have open mouths or closed mouths?


And he burned a legendary save.


Critical Role's most favorite things.


Inspire yourself.


Sure. Yes. Anything, anything to help the cause.


Can we go kill something now?


I'm going to cast-- really quickly since I have nothing else left, I'm going to cast Disguise Self and look like one of the lizard people.


Can I try and pop the lock? Is it like a chain and a lock?


Okay. I do a quick sprint jog up up towards Grog and go (boof) and bring up a big stone wall. Right where that entrance is.


Can I show this off real quick?


There's a lot of people in that caravan though, it seems like a risky maneuver.


Where on yourself does he come?


I was wondering if you were about to do it. Can you do it?


That's right. It is melee. Yeah, I'm staying right there. Plus six, so that's a 25.


Yeah, actually if I can hug the edge a little closer--


Okay. Who's the closest to me?


I think you and I are a little "Eh," in our own particular way.


I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows!


At one time, very close. Now? I don't think you'd want to be anywhere near her.


Fucking shit. Balls. Wisdom. Just wisdom?


And then the second attack is also sharpshooter, and that one hits.


And I think there's enough of us that we could all keep each other in check, from--


She could be Raishan.


IRL?


Yeah. It puts everything in perspective, though, I'll tell you that much.


2d6 plus eight, okay.


He is with us, yeah.


Thanks. I designed it like this.


Let's keep figuring things out.


Let Whitestone know what's going on. Because they're going to freak out if like--


I have no Doty. Who will record my exploits down here? Why am I here if not to record my adventures?


Ooh. No, I didn't miss that.


You look really-- can I? I'm going to brush your hair out of your face.


I thought we were having funsies!


Oh god, I feel like I should scootch over.


Giggling like idiots.


Ten gold?


You don't look in her ear--


It's not my mother's name. She wasn't well. Carry on.


He's got really good technique. He always brings a bottle of liquor with him.


Oh, that's big.


Is Vorugal back? He's back.


I move to it.


(laughs) That dice sucks.


Is there anything left inside of this?


He had nine of them.


So fourth level.


Oh man. I should try to track any footprints in there and see if there's something around the edges, maybe, that lead back to-- shit, I don't fucking know. It's only a couple of miles.


Yahtzee! Five, ten, 18, 28!


Mike Myers.


Oh my goodness. I've never seen anything like that!


Oh! I love it. And then for my move, my action, my whatever you call it... I've got fucking nothing, man! I say to the beast, to the whatever it is, I say, and another thing! Your smoking encourages minors to smoke and creates an aura that makes going to restaurants not pleasant and it's just horrible. It makes your clothes stink. It's terrible. So another Vicious Mockery.


Metal o'clock.


You know what, I'm just gonna pass it over to Trinket and make him hold it.


I'm not perceptive at all.


Zero means ten. That's a hundred. That's the best you can do.


Shaun. Can you get them out of here?


Are you suggesting now that we control the wills of the deities?


I'm going to use Luck. First luck. 22.


I got 4th-level spells and lower.


Oh wait, is it a necklace?


Oh no. This'll be funny. Come on, first good roll of the day. That'll do. That's a 16.


Okay, I feel very caffeinated right now.


He's still on top of me, isn't he?


Okay. I am going to cast Hunter's Mark.


Okay. Yeah! I'm going to drop Bigby's-- 60 feet is not plummeting speed? I can't catch up to them as they fall?


Is there any worth to only a few people, or one or two, going in to get a lay of the land, once we get there? Instead of just moving in our truffle-shuffle normal formation.


The official currency of it. Nice manacles.


I would like to confer with him very quickly before I go to sleep but other than that we are back and I look forward to making this move forward tomorrow morning.


That always works.


Caleb, come on.


Ablaze.


What was he doing? What was the effect?


That's going to be the saddest brothel.


(drunkenly) And we get our names on the board!


Oh. Okay, that's 29.


All right. We'll continue, then, until this is done.


You got this buddy, you got this.


But it's not the gate into Shadycreek Run.


For us?


You're at half. You're at 13 hit points.


Actually, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm incredibly low on funds at the moment.


Oh god! He does have a towel down.


Trust paranoid rich people to know.


Have you done stuff that's pirate-y before you were a pirate?


Was that with the Hex?


Fuck butt. Do I have any more movement? (counting) 25? Can I still try and go further one? With my 45 feet of movement?


But that could be the diversion, at least.


It's a thing of earth. Perhaps taking it to the surface is necessary to destroy it. Why don't we have a conversation with her?


We are ninjas.


We take fucking turns.


I'm going to hand him the book again and see if maybe there's focus to be found. Maybe this is--


Fucking hell. I'm going to do the same thing except I'm going to move to here and wait for something to attack one of my friends.


I'm at four.


She's so wanted.


Isn't he Pumat?


I don't know if I like you.


And do we get paid for such items?


An hour? All right.


You know, I grabbed his stupid cards.


I'm just going to pour very gingerly.


All of us are like, ahh.


Who dat? Who's up there? What's going on right there?


I'm gonna-- I'll stay, I'll stay.


13, 17, and 13.


Is it?


She can run out the tunnel that we came in.


Do you like that?


You did this. You did this.


Don't we have horses from our previous--


This is surprising coming from me, but I agree with that sentiment. You are covered in dead person.


I know, it's so begrudgingly.


I grab Scanlan, and we're taking off after her out the door.


What time?


You were crazy.


(laughing) It's mine, it's mine.


There's a lot to talk about, but not here. I have appearances to keep up, I have people depending on me who work for me.


Yes, I like that idea.


Oh my god. What the fuck!


19? Goddamn it. Yeah, that hits.


Another round, I've got it, I've got it.


No, the people inside will hear it. No, we need silence.


What are you guys doing? You guys leaving? Are you guys fucking leaving? You're not leaving without me are you?


I'm sorry, I was part of the fray as well. I was right in the thick of it. I saw a cart piled high with bodies. Are there people missing from town?


But he still has to roll concentration.


I'm pretty magic-stupid.


All right. And I sit down next to her and I scootch her a little bit. Thank you, Pickle.


How would everyone feel about another seven and a half hours?


If you recall, there were also five dragons and we killed one of them already.


That was so much worse than I ever thought it would be.


Still alive, mom.


How high are the ceilings in this store?


So that's not bad. That's 17 points of damage, plus three points of psychic damage and five points of necrotic damage.


He was evil.


Montana.


Are we assuming it's going to be as easy as all that?


I smell like cooked cow anus at the moment.


We look like healing bonus people to you?


If you can sketch it for us so we can get a sense of--


-- is today's sponsor. A leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over 30 years. That's almost as old as I am. Do you like magic? Pirates? Knives? Royals and adventure? Then check out Shades of Magic, the series from Tor Books. The conclusion of which, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so check out the full three-book series. Go to, there's a promo link somewhere on this page-- I'm gonna say right there. Let's say right there.


I'm shooting him in the eyeball, basically. That's a 29 to hit.


Yeah, I guess I'll just--


We did summon a pony and chop its head off.


Oh, what's that? Oh, it's Scanlan.


Just leave him behind.


I'm going to hang by the two sobering-up twins over here and keep an eye on that person.


Can we get water from the--


Baldrick, thank you. You are free to do with this as you will.


So you can look for that Q1 2017?


I know. I--


Gilmore's Building Supplies. (laughter)


You'll need this.


I search Molly's body and look for the tarot cards first.


Acrobatics? 17?


Did you have it fly down closer so you could see better?


Ah, son of a dick. All right, let's get this over with. And then she holds up her battleaxe and her warhammer.


(exhausted sigh) How was your night?


That sounds like a great song.


Yeah. I can make it to her.


Oh, yeah, I definitely don't see this.


Yep. Just drinking and thinking.


Nope. You owe me nothing. That's what friends are for.


Clearly. B) We don't all want to be all grouped together.


I don't think that I was with the group, I think I was back with the crowd--


It just works.


Like, could you tell from the bones it's a lot of bird people?


I'm just gonna break free from Ogden.


He flitters up to the finger.


That's going to be a while.


You know, I'm interested if there's a master lever to this prison. Just prison break, see what happens.


Caleb, who was just going into his bag to pull out a ro-- oh, she does not need the rope, okay. So instead I pull out the diamond and I start spinning it around and it turns to thunder and I sent that flying into the tannish colored-- Chromatic Orb to that one, yeah.


Oh, yay. Actually, it's 13. I lied.


How many hours since we've slept last?


Before we part, you seem to be quite learned about many things that I am not. Have you ever heard of anything called the God's Hammer or the Pale Stone? Or any particular artifact, Ropes of Mercy, perhaps?


He can also just take apart pieces of the model, that's amazing.


I got Pike.


Who needs aspirations?


Yeah, it wasn't like everybody left you. You left us.


Hi everyone! This time next week, we'll be doing this show in New York City!


Even at 6th-level, that's all it did.


Wait! I wanted to do a bonus action! I did want to do something on a bonus action.


That's our job!


Let's close it on that. I love these guys.


Did you build Dotty?


Well, you see, Marquis LePual let us know that you were in dire need of it, and that there was heavy coin and glory in its delivery. Now, as you can see, I lost my original crew and found these bunch of fuckwits. You see, I do owe them a little bit of coin for their trouble, and I sure would hate to leave them empty-handed. Plus I want to see what happens when you're reunited with your treasure.


That is true!


It dissolved it?


I got a weird thought. This may feel weird. I'm going to try my blood maledict.


(singing) We'll fucking lead as two kings!


Oh! Come on guys! That's awesome!


Only one of us is locked in.


Shit. So can anyone drag him down on his roll to save, or boost me?


Are we staying here? I mean, do you want to keep hiring us for always?


No, I have very thin lips, very long teeth, some would call them fangs. It's not my fault. When I smile, it looks like I'm trying to bite your throat off.


That was five!


You are adorably, fucking wrong right now.


I'm glad I saved Caleb.


I mean there was a door-- was it solid wood or did it have glass?


I'm going to get up and be like, Man, I've got to get that bracelet off that guy, god. Ugh. I'm going to--


No, I just have to figure out which ones I want to use that night.


Well, for a bit.


Sacred Flame, I mean.


Do you improve the reception by moving it around?


Specifically a location.


It's good to be alive.


Didn't remove a curse or anything?


I wouldn't have any religion, anything to base that off of?


That is 25.


I'm gonna get on the broom and fly up.


That was hot.


Can any of you read this?


I'm going to bet.


There's this thing on my body. I thought maybe you could take a look at it and you could tell me if it's good or bad? I don't know.


Are you still unconscious?


Right in the cave.


Happy birthday, Orion.


Can I crawl out from under the tent and clear the gap with them and get up to them?


I'm going to do it! 19.


That's so cool. That spell is so cool.


And Percy.


50 feet.


How did he find you?


Saving throw or just your ability modifier?


Do you have Daylight, still? Something with sun? I guess sunlight would take him out, because it's during the day.


He could have a whole infrastructure of people supporting him and then they would come after us.


Don't get touched by it. Don't let it touch you.


So you have two failures on you?


Yes. He does quite good work.


And then I say  It's okay, Grog. Everybody messes up sometimes, let me get this one. (laughter)


No, no, nope. Just bit myself in my sleep, that's all.


We could put it in the bag of holding or whatever.


He can walk! He can move!


Okay, I'll back into that alcove and attempt to hide in the alcove.


All right. Hold me tight. Mr. Mistoffeles, back down.


This guy.


There was a whole bunch of these guys in robes. It was really creepy.


For Pete's-- Sacred Flame.


40. 52.


What does it look like outside of the tree? Is the black muck still black mucky?


No, they had to go get Scanlan--


Uncanny Dodge?


Give me a d8. Okay.


Do you want to go left, I'll go right?


How can you be certain that you're the only chosen one of Uk'otoa?


I'm just going to hold.


Caduceus, you making breakfast?


You're a handsome woman, but-- you're a woman, right?


How long have you been working for the Marduns?


We do have some white scales left over, don't we?


No, it was like 24.


All you need is a five.


I know. Scratch that, three favors.


I just can't stop staring at his face, it's soaking wet! Sorry.


I have a sweet potato right here, Scanlan.


So, he's going to the auction to slave shop?


I'm going to do that. Wait, so I'm a bear now, so I get the Transform added to my weapon, yeah?


Grog looks good with a beard.


Well, we've all got to eat a little humble pie every once in a while. Even you.


Or glass of water.


Sorry. I sometimes forget about you, because you're on that side.


Oh, this is so exciting.


Laughter?


I don't have a plan B.


Oh, this is about grumpkins and periwinkles.


I hear Scanlan say that and I run out and I say, (shouting) fight!


But, Trinket--


(sobs)


To be honest, it intimidates me quite a bit.


I'm going to take some flowers and just stick one in his hair for good luck.


Could I hover on top of land? I want to stay in the air, but hover on top of land, please.


The giants got disintegrated.


It says "an eyelash encased in gum arabic."


I'll throw one more.


Well, look, we know-- we can't get over there.


(laughs) He's a complicated man. He goes to dark places.


It's like the giant eagle form. I just kind of modify it for style.


I would say that Caleb has spent a lot of time over the last several years in woods. Can I check to see if I have ever heard that cry before?


This is shitty. Can I roll for insight and make sure that she's trustworthy? I feel like she's trustworthy, but--


It's okay, stand down, Lionel. I can defend myself.


Darth Vader.


(singing) Bring out the map!


Hi, everybody, I'm Sam Riegel and welcome to Late-Night Deals. Guys, online backup systems. Just the sound of it gives me a headache. It's always so complicated, expensive, and frustrating. Am I right? Usually, when you back up your data, you look like this guy.


The Parchwood Forests are dangerous as they are. There's really no safe way.


Even Beast Shape?


And are there rumors of about him bring in anything else? Anything illicit? Or is it kind of "what you see is what you get?"


I guess we should breathe underwater and head down, right?


I'm going to back off into the corner then.


Pillaged?


Who's doing a Blight spell?


The Guiding Bolt streaks through the air, loops down to the ground, up through the butt, up out the head, and out the mouth. Everyone vaguely hears, "That's my Pike." And its head explodes.


I think it's been a day.


Where did you find that?


So that's 40 on the last one.


This could be the dumbest--


Oh no. It can jump that high?!


And not as a trade, but as a favor for just the effort, or maybe because I'm not strong enough as a sorcerer myself to do it.


It's an action?


I cast Pass Without A Trace. Everyone stand near me. And I'll turn into an eagle and I scoop up the gnomes.


My go, okay. Let me put these hit points in. Apply changes.


Look, we're basically gods, okay? (laughter)


We can't say destroyed because we don't know how we did that, right?


He's dead. And so was the horrible bastard who was pouring poison in his ear. But listen, I gave power up to the Herd, to Zanror, his son.


There's a sign that says "Closed for adventuring."


Stop doing that! You'll get everyone drunk. Even worse. That's actually a natural one.


Do you have a training ground? Like an arena that's kind of comparable we can test in tonight?


Western side of the mountains?


Chimney.


We're going to add on to-- Mistake is funny, too. I like that. Can I read this code?


Don't let anybody read it.


Yeah, I was writing real fast.


Drop it in a thorny patch.


Nice, Percy.


Tri-Spires. Thank you. Got it.


I meant two-handed. Oh no, I'm throwing it.


I would've stopped you, darling. I knew it was him right away.


Why do you sound like a bear?


Those are on the ceiling?


Uh-oh. Saving throw?


No, no, no, I mean, there's some boring bits of it, obviously.


I never heard about this. How did you hear about this?


Yep. Doesn't say too much.


Wait, did you not have-- Jesus, never use that thing again.


All right, I'll send a wand of fireballs down. I don't know, is that magic actually hot when it goes off?


That's going to be 21.


You said her name. It's all right.


You'll abuse it. You've already abused that privilege already.


I'm unsure. It's hard to tell.


Anybody else?


I'm gonna fly down and tell Captain Adella.


You-- headphones, dear-- you fucked some random woman in a city you passed through, and you expect us to feel sorry for you?


Insurance? No, we are in a podunk town, there is no insurance here.


There we go. Thank you. Where are they?


Thanks so much.


Have you been treating Caleb well?


Then we plant that in Sutan elder’s house when we successfully, quietly break in.


Single-handedly protecting a whole city right now.


Yeah! See, we're sailors, now!


-- bonus, I guess. So 14.


It is beautiful. I will admit we have many tasks that weigh upon us that bring us here. I have two favors that I would ask of you, and I understand if they're not possible.


Where's the dead body?


It was fun. I was honored.


No, it's-- oh, that's, you're right.


No! Cure Wounds!


And you said it's flickering, the light?


Yes. Unless there's something new, then yes. I was born here.


Are we at the door yet?


I'm in the water, yeah.


That's a 20.


Are there any big rock formations that I can sort of use as a shelter and kind of stay behind that but also peek around?


Ulog’s probably listening to us right now.


Maybe we can climb a tree! Are there any tall trees?


The book said the soul is bound to the flesh be it in any form, ice or ash, but the ash in the pots was the will-o'-wisp.


Are you feeling okay, Vex?


We're on Tal'Dorei.


Keg! Keg! Keg!


A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the AraMente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the AraMente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?


I know his name is fucking Kashaw. So he's not there.


You would die. You would suffocate and be crushed from the pressure of the earth.


Are you still raging?


Go on, get out.


And once there's a good gash in the name, I'm going to sit down and breathe.


Oh, Keyleth?


Moana!


But, but--


You dive in front of me to do that?


Yeah, that's what we think all the time.


He almost died! How did you do?


Can we see to the ceiling of this chamber?


I would like a seat at the table, if that's all right?


Can we just sleep? I'm so tired.


Oh, deception, deception.


Kids and puppies!


I'm up again?


I got a 14, anyone want to help me look for magical scheisse?


Kaitiaki, Uvenda.


I think we should go shopping.


Is one the same as another?


Can we avoid that and still head left of the keep?


Cinnamon Tower.


You guys have been the greatest friends ever, but I've spent my whole life in a box. I'm going to go exploring.


I look at Pike. I turn around, I look at Vex. You'll thank me. And I'd like to try and pull the skull out of her hands.


We don't know yet, but you have many men, and they seem like good fighters, so we may call upon you in the future.


We made this thing?


We're immune to fear?


I'm going to pop Trinket out of the necklace and cast Cure Wounds on him.


That was lovely, thank you.


What an episode.


Very tall and metallic-looking.


Try to scry on him! He's probably having a bad day. There's enough time.


I start running.


Yeah, I do have a cask, actually.


Do I have a-- no, never mind, that's not a bonus action. Never mind, sorry. Was going to try Healing Hands.


Oh. Well next time, could you include me in it? I don't know if maybe it would help me with my skills.


Be ready to run.


I want to get to its left hind quarters. I’m going to run over to the opposite side, flank it with the lollipop.


I'm going to sit on the ground. I'm going to look through my stuff, see if I have anything that can hold it.


What's in the sack?


Entropis is the tower?


I have most everything I need already. Why would I need more stuff?


Any kind of advantage on that? For growing up there or something?


Firm, but fair. Yes.


Okay, we'll take it all back upstairs.


Oh no, we have to go back!


I feel like we should go at this with a little bit of theatricality. Just because it's so much fun to fuck with Grog.


Wait, so you ran away?


I think we should be careful, because the longer we're in town, the more people we talk to, the more people might decide that they're invested in us staying.


Plus my con modifier, yeah?


I pull Vex into an alleyway. (sighs) I don't know what the right thing to do is. I thought one thing going in there.


Hey, that's good news!


Caleb heard that.


Come give us a squeeze. We'll be at the convention hall and we'll be over at Petco in both places at different times.


Yeah, yeah. In years ago.


Really, it’s our money now.


Kick in the door. Hard as I can.


Oh, what's that?


I kinda maybe wrap them around, just for a little super there.


What do you mean, Sondur?


That is doubling both of the dice. Now a sharpshooter shot.


Yeah, everybody seems to be avoiding it, it sticks out in the general area, and there's no doors. I just found it odd. Maybe it's a puzzle?


Okay. I take off running. (laughter)


You certainly could. I don't see what harm it could bring.


Do we all fight the same type of creature?


Merkin?


Percy, I need you for your words, and Keyleth for your magic. Let's go.


Got it. That's a 17.


Cassandra's still up, right?


And it's all you guys' fault!


What came between boatswain and navigator?


Yeah, that is weird.


Watch out for bear traps.


Can I get to here on a turn? I can't tell.


No, there's four of us, and I'm one of the four.


It's red. All flashing red.


What do the boots do?


He is on this week's episode of GM Tips.


Tide Peak.


They're in the city?


Put "it" aside?


Getting after it! Wasting no time.


She can move to us. Never mind.


Hashtag D&Diesel.


It has been a really long day so far.


I start putting the Dust of Tracelessness down on the ground so it looks like nobody's been here.


That's awesome, excuse me, that is fucking wunderbar. That is wunderbar if they were all clumped together, but I'm going to give it a 50/50 chance of them being in a line.


Yes. Because one of the other minion guys was like, "Odell, go tell Viscon."


It's a DM call on him, I think. Or how he wants to translate it.


Is your beret still on?


Should we have been keeping track of which ones were on which wall?


We come in.


I'm going to stay here. No, I'm going to go after everybody else.


Yeah, I rolled the first one, which was a 24, but with advantage. That's less, so 24.


I shoot the other one with a gun.


Don't do it like that. You know that shit's important.


Yeah, 19.


What goes around comes around, baby. 22.


A 14 in history wouldn't do anything?


Listen, if we do run across a dragon, remember we have the dragon slayer longsword, which is a plus one to attack and damage rolls, and if you hit a dragon or a dragon creature, it gets an extra 3d6 of damage.


You could get rid of the fog.


Oh god, it's on. Here we go.


Oh that's true, he does have a chain weapon.


Would I know anything with six eyes? Big rhino thing with six eyes?


You guys are going to join this time.


I think it's 16,800?


Let's not cast it near the portal, though.


Oh, god. We let something out.


Okay. Well then, I will cast Slow on the shallow priest and the one that's laughing in front of me as well as I back away.


I hate him so much!


Ten to whatever we roll.


You're going to have an alien axe?


So considerate of you.


Yeah, that's pretty good. Feel pretty proud of that.


How heavy are they?


Oh, we'll be back. Don't worry.


How about Marge?


I'm Fjord Tusktooth, quartermaster of the Squalleater.


Oh, I rolled a 13.


So I'm going to hop on the carpet.


Thank you. It's very old. Okay, Fassbender. Rest.


Well, when was the last time we saw Tary?


How does it feel on that side? When I played with Will Friedle--


Can I still see the writing?


(grunting) Okay. Point me at the thing.


26 for investigation on the door.


I should have been more specific.


That's a 15 and a natural 20.


We're all stuck together, unfortunately.


I take my hand and scratch the back of my head. (all laugh)


Same thing again.


No, I mean, the fourth time I've cast a 3rd-level spell.


No-- I was going to say I cast Guiding Bolt at her, but--


You've got advantage, so why not, fuck it.


Oh god, I'm sorry. I have this burn in my butt from all the smoke you just blew up my ass. It's just, oh god. Is that a magical talent?


I cast Cure Wounds on her.


In combat.


I go to Scanlan. Scanlan?


Can we look around and see if there's any way to, a bell to ring that's outside of that area.


What flying things have we seen that are scary?


I have my blood axe.


Yeah! I'm a-coming up there to kill some - some things. (all laugh)


You cursed at my funeral?!


I was just going to say, I'm going to do a quick scan. See if there's anything of interest.


Any preference to water versus, perhaps, an abundance of dry ground?


Great. Will do. Another thing that we realized-- in our efforts to frame and forge, which are vast, you don't happen to have any handwriting from Lord Sutan, do you?


(sighs) Seriously?! Can I have some of the fancy cloak? Grog, out of the Bag of Holding, please?


A mere 16.


So I can do this on my own then?


A little omission maybe?


I was wanting to ask you, Gilmore. Have you considered maybe doing potion-making workshops?


I look at Caleb across the library.


Taryon Darrington. He needs to know the name.


I'm only seeing the greaters.


Three of these are D&D familiars. Which is the real bar? The Naughty Pig, the Mantrap, the Steel Predator, the Cockatrice.


Nope. We should leave the dump.


Huzzah to Zac!


Unless letting Trinket out of the necklace, does that count as my bonus action?


It'll take me 11 minutes to be able to read this if I can.


It hits me.


We're ready whenever you are.


I give her my potion of healing. Regular healing.


Scanlan has had the craziest last hour ever!


I was really looking for a reason to say yes.


Wait, what are you sharing?


So it went hunting.


And she was which? Who was the Countess again?


Not just this weekend. In six hours.


Yes. Yeah, he kind of set the bar really high.


Anytime you want.


You back the fuck up right now.


Okay. So he will swirl away and go back to the second and do the same look around.


No last thing.


You all right, Caleb?


Fill the hole.


Wait, together?


Happy new year, everybody.


May I see it?


Does it have to be, though?


We're new around here.


Oh, don't lose that fucking digit.


Oh. That's pretty cool.


Thadeus, did they seem to be after anything in particular? Were they here for property or people or gold or food?


Maybe we'll see you very soon.


Oh, the box? Yeah, of course. I dig into the haversack and show it to him.


Until then, he's a gimp.


My staff.


We can hear everything that happens.


Okay, great. So my Armor of Agathys is still up?


The main thing is to get the illithid, because if he's out, nobody's-- Then they're all separate. He's playing chess with all his minions until we take him out.


I'll also say that I'll hold an attack if an efreet pokes its face in the door.


The One Ring to rule them all.


Would the cabinet have a French accent when it talked?


What urges?


Can I hold my... turn until Keyleth goes?


Blow the cover for ev-- well.


As my reaction, I bring up my shawm-- it's a horn-- and I blow the note. The note is like Dumb and Dumber, the sound he makes? (off-key horn noise) That most annoying sound. (off-key horn noise) And mash all my fingers down.


Okay. That's 11.


Well, enjoy it while you have it.


But I don't ever-- oh, okay.


Almost! Almost!


D'you want to get your whole body in there?


Oh, right, Pike. Right.


I'll use my movement to gather whatever bits of Vax I can still see.


Ah, that's fair. For your trouble. I'm going to pull out one of my teas.


I'm going to loot this corpse real quick. See if I see anything with this.


Soon.


Well, go fucking find them.


All right, family's here tonight, so everything has to be on its best, all right? The best stuff we have in this kitchen. These are Trickfoots. We have to treat them right, and we have to treat them well.


We have to get Fjord out of that window somehow.


Let's get back to the Leaky Tap. We've seen the power of the Dwendalian Empire. That was more than anything I've ever seen, we've got to get back.


Yeah, just real quick.


My turn? Okay, so I would like to Channel Divinity and Destroy Undead?


Time of day, I know. That's part of the feat. I know the hour of the day.


All right, so now we have seven of those things, and we have to get eight of us through.


You know, it's interesting, I understand exactly zero percent of what the DM was saying while he was in-character as that particular character due to the nature of Skype and microphones.


Would you like to see the library?


She usually buries them quite well.


Shoot again. That's better. 25.


It's coming up on April 11th. We're going to be live-streaming Tabletop Day from here in this studio. Probably not as complicated a setup as this, but similar of a set up. For those of you that have not registered yet for International Tabletop Day, go to the website tabletopday.com or org, I could be saying it wrong, the chat room will let you know.


I try to yank it over.


Yeah. You did all right.


Reverence.


So many things.


Tyrelda.


We're going to ask him this downstairs. I just want to take it to you and see if everyone thinks that we're going this direction. We'll make the most comfortable deal we can, but honestly, I'm very curious if anybody has any better ideas.


Is that the takeaway from this? You should have killed the guard? I'm just checking.


I mean, I can do it if you want to.


That's probably not my plan. Can I have use of your blade?


Not bad. Do you want me to break it down, piercing and necrotic?


You might be feeling some issues right now if it were cursed.


Yup. Hey, you!


I've got a vial with yellow and black swirly stuff in it.


You wanna go for a ride?


I just scrooch under his giant neck. You want to be friends with me?


Are we supposed to meet up with him later tonight?


I think I would have noticed that the circus bouncer looking in the urn did not get blown up, but also looked a little puzzled. So I'm going to go over and take a look at the same thing.


What is that plus?


Am I actually able to-- If I have my hand on his jaws, just pull them apart.


Oh, do I have to cast a saving throw or am I fine?


Do I know what kind of meat?


Pike, heal?


Great, and will hold a melee attack in case something comes within her range.


This was meant for me.


Can I clock the room, see who else is watching her count?


So I see water and I shove my face down in it and breathe it. Who knows, with me? And I go back to where I burned my fucking foot, and I go into the earring-- I'm not going to fucking jump over that shit again-- tell them what I saw. Yeah, two minutes. So deep fucking breath. Yeah?


Scanlan will be in the rear.


Okay, I'm going to slowly start pacing around towards the front. I'm also going to look into the windows. Do I see anything from my vantage point?


Yes. I think we tell Allura before we un-stone Lady Kima. Everything that's happened--


(whispering) Hide yo wives.


We're pulling down right after three.


Episode title  The Blue Job. (laughter)


My spell books are in there, so please-- I can't hear anything.


I'd say that's pretty fucking sick.


In the past, in other locations, you mean?


Up and over the wall?


Can I look and see if I see any big broken branches, or sign of something big moving through the forest?


And I am looking for what?


He'll find out in the morning. This is good. We'll start looking with the new data as soon as everyone gets here. This is excellent. Excellent! Good night. Go to sleep. Why are you awake? No! And I'm out the door. I run to Vex's house. We're done.


Stealth cloak? Do you have a stealth cloak?


Can't cast through it.


Night saved.


That's right, we were in this inn the whole time.


Yes. We were going to look into trying to do that. Well, is there anything you need from me, Patisse, before we head on?


When you-- do you remember-- okay.


But will they know what the flag looks like? Will that be part of the information that exists about the ship?


All right, shall we all go to the manor?


No! I didn't do nothing, we just went to a show.


Just give me one.


Yeah, I like that. I'll run and-- staying a good distance in-- I'll drop off the docks under the water and start swimming.


I know. From Buzzfeed. Together, they are Lewberger, and they're going to be playing here, and I'm going to be doing some songs with them and performing with them, as well. Check it out for Gather Your Party tomorrow. What time is that, sorry Zac?


Who were you talking to?


Her or you?


Thank you!  Much better!


Not the final episode of the show!


She's made of armor and they're people with sticks, with sharp sticks.


When I went around the ruins, did I notice how large the stones were that had fallen in for the blocked entrance?


My god, we're saved.


And then I'm going to jump and I'm going to crawl down the rest of my way and join him outside the house. And try and jump around the fire, dragging him away from the fire.


Scanlan, I would be Scanlan.


Caleb will remember this.


15 on the second, does that hit?


-- but if you feel the urge to actually take it upon yourself--


You go to a casino in Marquet, you gamble. You go to hell--


Yeah, we'll be in the studio.


They've got a pirate store, a superhero store. They have a time-travel store.


25 and 28.


It's wonderful when two people can fall in love and have each other forever and ever. That's nice. No, I mean it! You guys are great. You're super cute together. You'll make Whitestone-- You'll be celebrities there.


Does it make a very good macaroni and cheese?


So since I'm in contact with it--


Oh but we have Heroes' Feast, is that good?


They're in the booth, going (whispers) we're not getting any of this!


I'm going to start making my way a decent distance and running a little bit off the road, I'm going to try and find some cover and get ready to injure a horse.


What's that? What do we add?


Oh my gosh. I start crying. This is the most proud moment of my life, Mertin. I've admired you for so long and the fact (cries) thank you. And then I just hug him.


It's out?


If it makes you feel any better, I lost money on Jester on the next one.


Wait, no, we need that.


I let go of my arrow and cast Conjure Barrage with a holy arrow at them.


Do we just want to get arrested? Or do we want to actually end up where we need to be?


Let's go be social.


Using my Mage Hand, I'm like, it's one of the things that you wanted us to get.


You've already made a sale, and you have more back at the--


Its most majestic part fell off.


He has disadvantage on all of his physical attacks for the next round.


And there's a really beautiful strong bow in the Feywild.


Sam will write a ballad.


This is the craziest 48 hours, I swear to all the gods.


So we're gonna break the seal on some untampered-with magics and just experiment.


Are you so nervous, Matt?


Who else is bad?


Wrong dice! Why did you use that dice?
