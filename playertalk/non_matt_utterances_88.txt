I am going to cast 5th-level Blight on him. He is a plant creature! I get how much extra?


Grog, is there nothing else in that bag of holding?


How much have you hoarded up here? Just us, or more?


That ripped, chiseled old man?


Did you see it? It collapsed.


I think this needs to be gold, dear.


Oh, because he has a second...


It's cultists and Delilah left?


Very nice!


There were these wrinkled testicles that were walking around on feet.


I'm going to spend some time working on the special barrel and see if I can get that up and running.


That would put us at about 30,000 that we have to spend left, which the signal cut out so it doesn’t matter.


I had cast fire resistance on me.


No one else on this side of the table is going to take any meaningful notes.


But I'm cooking.


I will let her know to expect us.


True, good point.


Oh, where is she?


I'll back up into that far corner.


Trinket's doing that thing where he pulls with his front feet and drags with his behind.


We didn't actually even defeat it.


Ten minutes.


Jester cut him! He can't see you out there, cut him!


I'm not going anywhere.


I'm sorry! I'm trying to remain calm, too!


Odell was the one holding the sphere, right?


Fuck yeah! If she's getting a beacon.


Yeah, you get plus two to all your healing spells.


We never got that stuff back.


Do we need to post guards outside?


24 to hit?


Tatonka.


Natural 20. Golden snitch.


I have a suggestion.


It's fucking your family. It's the people that attacked your family. Do you have no contribution to this?


Wait, I don't want to get punched in the face while I'm blind. Somebody please put a hand on my shoulder--


Completely crazy. Bonkers.


Of course, dear.


One quick thing.


It depends on how altruistic this group is. We already have a job. I mean, I will defer to the group, but we have a job and we are on a time table.


Hey, Thadeus.


Well, I thought they were like 0.3 seconds apart, so I thought it was so fast.


What did you cast?


I've got a really good idea. Wait. No! Grog, pick up something really heavy, and throw it as far as you can.


Scanlan?


(laughs) Bowing down like he's been knighted.


And now the lower left-hand corner.


Ah, you're hitting me with your shoulders.


Is this everybody you could round up to get out of the city?


We got an actual dice roll in the game!


Are you putting in the f-- well.


Yeah, she does. I'm just saying.


Are there rules or are we just allowed to use whatever we come into the tournament with?


He's probably going to have centuries getting his shit back together. He's probably really pissed.


Against them


And rage would have no effect on this?


Here’s the thing. He’s not a joke-telling kind of comedian. He’s more of a farce kind of comedian. Physical comedy. It’s more like a jester, if you will. And I push him and-- so he falls down. See?


I felt a great force behind me, pushing me forward! And then all of a sudden I opened my eyes and was in a new place. Doty, take this down. Today is the greatest day of Taryon Darrington's life. The day that he experienced the wonder of the gods. That's enough for now.


Athletics. Ooh, I rolled an 18.


Yes, but they're protected.


Your hands are going to be all sticky before you handle the books.


So, that might not be enough.


Oh, I don't need it. That's 27.


I can spend more time fleshing out and reinforcing the bunkers to make them--


Where did my thing go?


He’s not intimidated yet.


Yeah. It was two, right?


Is it attacking me?


Can I get the guy in the crevasse? The 30-foot-high?


What you got? What do you got, Grog?


And donuts!


I do. We've sent word. They'll be awake, I imagine. Is Gilmore still in town?


Or some sort of disguise, distraction.


Let's cut it down.


Back into warm piss water, instead of boiling hot.


Oh, um. Hunter's Mark. Damn it. Bonus action!


I just know if I saw a ghost, I would want to punch it. Ghosts are scary.


Allura?


You know, I said something like that to her. It wasn't as black and white as that.


(belches loudly) (laughter)


All right. Eh. That's nine. And the other one is 11.


If we're in a hurry, I mean we've killed some pretty gnarly things, I know they're big. So are we.


For undead.


Yeah, these are hot rocks here.


No, but we'll keep it.


You should totally put some stuff up there.


Oh! I want to use my holy oil and dip a couple arrows in the holy oil because I know I can make three based on what we've done before.


I'm going to bolt. Full speed.


I'm sorry, what was that name?


Maybe you could do a Grog tour and then a Percy tour.


I touch Grog's shoulder and I give him four hit points.


Wow, that's the whole layout, Frumpy.


Ja, that's exactly where I want to be. And then I will scooch down, not fully sitting but like bending my knees down and doing like a squat. And thinking, This is okay. This is okay. That's the end of the turn.


Sure. Any reason why?


Who runs in a haunted house now? That's fucking amazing.


Can I roll for acrobatics? Maybe I can catch myself.


You're already taking a good hard look at your decisions. This is good.


What did you say to me, Nott? Some are people are just good?


(robot voice) -- perished under the might of the Loot Crate armies. Now, all live in harmony. You humans must begin the peaceful transition by visiting primitive webpage lootcrate.com/criticalrole. And use promo code CRITICALROLE for 10% off this month's crate theme, Investigate. Items from Stranger Things, Batman, The X-Files, and Marvel's Jessica Jones. That include a figure, detective must-haves, and our awesome monthly tee and pin. I must return to my timeline. Until we meet in the future, good crate, and may the loot be with you! Bleep! Blop! Blorp! Bleep! Blop!


Well, I only have one.


Third level.


Keeping watch?


The depth of the wall?


Where are they in relation to us too, by the way?


Yeah, I mean, I don't want to move.


Is this against the bear?


If it's too dangerous, we'll stand down. How about that?


Enjoy, gentlemen! And lady.


I turn to Fjord as it misses and say  Eh, yeah. (laughter)


That gives me advantage, but that gives them advantage on attacks.


I like to think there's a piece of paper like pinned to his wall right now.


Okay, I get one more, but I'm not ten feet away from Beau and Jester, right?


Who was that man? That was Taliesin Jaffe, Mayor of Ren Faire!


That's where we're going, yeah.


Yeah, we're trying not to let it get away.


They're going to be pixies with giant dickbutts everywhere.


Tell anyone you'd like where I went. It's not a secret. I just wasn't ready to... I don't think your brother-- I would hate for him to think I'm competing. I just had some questions.


I'm going to go 15 feet behind us.


Cut my eyes! Cut my eyelids off!


And that's not just a descriptor, either.


(singing) There is a lady all in white...


Does he seem like he's going to kill us?


I have a feeling that no one in this town could afford it right now. But when we get to--


I think it's paint, I think it might be paint, they were painting.


I'll take the side.


All right, I'll wear it.


No! (yelling)


It would take them a few days to get there?


Oh, ja, I am sorry. Also, I am in need of maybe 20-30 gold's worth of fine incense, if you have that as well.


And a druid.


I don't know. Can you conjure those golden orbs up into the air as like a signal?


That's not a bad idea. What would bring Kevdak out?


Hey, first throwback! Well done.


Whew. Thank goodness. I'm wearing my cloak, so I get advantage. That's a natural 20.


You could always look in Doty's diary and find out exactly what happened.


Shouldn't there be an ad for Gilmore's Glorious Goods right about now?


I do another sword check.


A perception check? I am a million-- eight.


11, 12.


It's an illusion, just let her go.


Michael's had a stationery sale!


I don't know! Give me 20 minutes!


That'll do. That's 20 points of damage.


I don't trust squirrels; they're tree rats.


I was going to say, do you have Pass Without a Trace, can you summon any more spells?


Or flying in my footsteps, rather.


Okay, what am I trying to learn?


I jump up on a chair and I yell to the students: Instructor Kashaw has instructed us that this is a drill! You are to attack that man right there, that large man, as a test of your strength and training. Now!


Are we about to have a debate about boots? I'm against them! Your turn.


I think, Matt, you're wrong.


Well, should we just purchase what you need via the honor system and leave some coin behind?


Kima?


Just hits. Uncanny Dodge.


Fifty gold.


"Where I saw that child?" I slit his throat.


Vax! Vax! Hold her hair back! Hold her hair back.


I grab and shake it, with my thumb over the spigot.


I'm glad I used half my spells trying to get into this goddamn place.


And then go find Zahra.


Do we need to check in with creepy guy?


We can maybe try and get Pike.


Do you want to make some food? We have a lot downstairs: two weeks' worth.


Yeah, let's step out of the range, see what happens.


But it is a really cool trick. They got to see magic.


And there were these giant magical sigils that borked the carpet. Which was fine. It was fine, because the thing started to go down--


We should find that dagger. No question.


And if I say no and they take all of our possessions and our estate, everything, what then? We're ruined.


I do too.


Damn it, we should have done that check last time. "Can we check for citric acid?" "You can certainly try." (laughter)


Listen. My clan, I can't speak for other clans, but the goblins that I was with for quite some time, we stole from people. We stole food, we stole money when we could, we stole clothing and provisions, but when times were tough, we would steal the people, too.


Come here, boys. Come here. I take out some beef jerky. Come here. That's good boys. Good boys.


Illiteracy.


Which one's which? (all laugh)


You will get used to it. I just laugh along now.


I will ignore the guy next to me and I will Hand Cone it up, and I will-- he's got two riders?


And I'll roll the second one, just to have it. That's nine. Nah, nine'll miss. Thankfully will not-- that's great. 26 points of damage.


Look, as someone who still doesn't have any type of dreams, whatever's going on, it's not normal, I just want to point that out.


That's right, we've got some humans.


And, yeah. So a little bit of backstory about GameChanger. About nine years ago, I was diagnosed terminal form of cancer. I was given about two weeks left to live, but thankfully it's been a long two weeks. I'm totally healthy now. (cheers)


Are we still buying this?


By the way, Caleb has stayed behind. He has no interest; he is keeping the hut up and petting his own cat and watching.


There! Yes, thank you.


That sounds absolutely fantastic.


How close am I? I can't see.


It was one-handed, so 1d8. Ten points of damage.


I also think, Freddie, that you're more capable of resisting temptation, as you say. Sorry, Yrat.


Can we take his weapon from him since he can't move?


I'm not looking, Batman's not looking.


What a fucking delight Twiggy was!


Still would have been shit.


Is the entity still lifting boulders?


I did on the round before. I feel like I have one more round but I don't think I did. Did you, though? Because it moved out of your range!


(singing) Here comes the sun--


I can try to fit it in the bag.


Can I just say this? Can we just leave Trinket behind--


Take the blankets.


Holy shit, that's good.


Bahn mi, the Vietnamese sandwich that you can get in many places?


Does anyone speak Marquetian, or do they speak Common there?


We need to get our armor.


You don't know any Mending magic, do you?


Yeah. I'll hold on to it.


Full-on misfire. (cackles) Yeah, I misfire. I don't care; we got a bear.


We've done very right by him, but we've also tipped him off to the fact that you assume that he might know your mother at a more intimate level.


I told her not to say it, why'd you say it?


I'm going to put out these fires. Oh, I'm not getting up.


Jester, can you go ahead and cast a spell?


We were just in a tavern all day.


Are we still in the room?


No, it doesn't hit!


I was going to say, if we can get something to blind it, it's still just a lens.


Oh, Oskar.


Without a doubt.


Is that General Krieg? (screams) (all laugh)


Let them feel at ease. Go ahead.


Jester, why don't you keep that?


We're getting some distance from whatever.


The blacksmith's? Oh. I think I can only do short swords and looking at a crossbow.


He knew a lot of things, yes. I don't think he was completely wrong, and that's what makes me feel terrible.


They've already stopped, though.


Me?!


My name's Lionel, you guys.


Yeah, all right. I wait... Deuces, you coming in?


We hear it.


You did what you had to.


It doesn't say on my thing. It's a dex save.


I pull a stick out of my coat, and I hold it between thumb and pinky like this, and there's a string wrapped around it, and I take my fingers, and I pull along the string, which begins to glow a faint gold glow, and a being, same height, and about same skinny-ass proportions as myself appears before me.


On "smealth." He who "smealth" it.


Oh my god, that's amazing! (flapping) We're running, it's bad! (laughter)


So many things to do.


All right, I'm going to go up to it. Get it sliced. Raging, reckless. Divine-- no, I can't do divine.


And you're on watch, right? Before I passed out I handed him my cloak, all wadded up in a ball around it, and handed it to him.


We'll go to your father's place first. I think we'll maybe, if we're in the mood, pop into their place while they're not home, perhaps.


I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm kidding, kidding, I'm totally kidding.


My dad was super protective and I was an asshole and rebelled a lot.


New characters.


Oh, this is like when we first started and we were in a line. You guys remember, and we were looking for that witch?


From a meteorite?


I'm a musician.


Chocolate's expensive, here.


Oh my God, really?


Did you even tell us what's in the cage, since we never even looked?


Can I ascertain if there's any type of draft or any--?


Scanlan's a kingslayer.


A milk chaser for your whiskeys?


Just try to get Marius out, right?


How did this happen?


I don't think I can shift it. No, you can't. That's a one-time thing.


Does it realize that anybody but Grog is there?


He doesn't get advantage?


Can't hear me, or it won't work?


You know, I'm a little tuckered. I'm going to take a rest upstairs. I'm going to copy that last spell into my book. I'll see you guys in a little bit, maybe around dinner time.


Why do you hate children, Vex?


I'm confused. I want to see what happens to those two when they follow.


(sobbing) No, far too calm.


Now, between you and I--


Is this a spray or a cloud?


That's a 16.


But I mean somewhere I could put a bed for myself and Trinket with very high ceilings.


Okay. I feel silly. I mean, I gave it to you a year ago or so, but, I don't know, I missed him. I think I missed him.


60 gold each.


So we have to try harder. It didn't work.


Not even close. If you order now, you'll get Backblaze for just five dollars a month for unlimited and unfryable backup.


I look forward to the lesson.


Do you want to make a special announcement?


I can make the tunnel across the way look like it's caved in.


My constitution must be low, mine's three.


I got a 12.


Damn it, fuck, mother bitch. No, it doesn't hit.


Scanlan, underwater breathing or air, oxygen supplies?


Okay. You and I, we have an agreement. A pact.


Then I won't use it.


I'm going to run up to Scanlan and I'm going to cast Death Ward on him.


You could go get your sickle.


Here you go.


We're over his family's keep?


That slipped out of my hand. It doesn't count if it slips out of your hand. Ten points of damage! That's my bonus. For my actual thing, can I do a cantrip?


A very good book.


And a unique opportunity to maybe really fuck up a dragon. If we want to be smart.


Are you okay? Do you need healing?


Yeah! Or maybe my manservant. Can you make me look really amazing?


Hanging out with you guys!


I'll take a couple as well.


Your hands are dirty! You're covered in bread!


Yeah. That's a--


Scanlan on the floor. Everybody flee; there's a dinosaur.


Yeah, nobody's there.


Fluffernutter?


Boulder-parchment-shears.


Well, then I cast it again.


I could do that--


I read my Scroll of Spirit Guardians. I call them forth to protect us in this moment.


He just got pet stored, so--


It's a lot. (laughter)


That was Greyspine's cousin.


We've been stealthing for not too much space. I think that I could get pretty far.


They're small.


Can I Druidcraft some web hammocks?


(singing) Natural 20!


It worked. Never mind.


So I'm having trouble seeing the battle map. Grog is right against a wyvern, right?


Oh, the things I sacrifice for the group.


It's a ring?


Oh sorry, I just have back issues. I'm just stretching.


Oh my gosh. At the end as always.


Yeah, does it feel out of place?


They had me eat--


I thought you knew me inside and out.


It's days down here, Trinket. We're imprisoned forever! This fucking title! I thought I wanted it! I thought I did!


How long have you lived here?


What can I see, like if I go down, what can I see?


I walk up to him.


Look where you are right now, son.


If you ever find yourself in the Material Plane and need a tour guide--


All right, so then, I'll hop through, through Percy and my sister. And run up behind the shithead who's fucking with Keyleth.


Sorry, Doris. You'd better just lie down.


I mean, no, because, I mean-- (groans)


Well, I have had many adventures and close calls, but I won't bore you with those details. It's been an interesting year abroad, and I would say I'm glad to be back, but for the abduction part and also the fact that I've now learned that we are destitute? Is that true?


Crafting party.


I go where Pike goes.


I think the key might be here, but I don't really know.


We can do it.


Wait! What?


Does it affect people in the dome?


I feel like we should probably bring a little more water than one bucket. So we should spend a little bit of time doing that. But maybe my sister and I can have a look around, see if there's anything that we've missed. Outside.


That says what the distance on Locate Object is.


We are not cool right now.


He's the Lord of the Quadroads now.


Try blinding him with science, that usually works.


Oh, jeez. I shout out-- I run towards the other water portal.


Well, maybe we should sleep. Try to camp for the time--


But the safe house is in the swamp, it's not in Berleben, right?


What if he goes in to like a protection service or something?


Bitches gonna die!


So. Wait. I'm sensing... would that help you to know that K'Varn is an aberration?


Oh, okay. I'm sorry if I hurt you.


I'm also going to use my movement. Is there enough room to fly safely over big skeleton?


Hmm, I don't think so.


Shit, yeah. Wait, wait, wait, so if we were in a fight and things went really south--


I saw, when and how did you all start playing together? The reason this started is because, I directed Matt as Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil 6, and every time he came in he would say, "hey, you know, I'm running a game, you can come in and just do a one off." And I was like, "oh, I got babies, I can't do that, I can't do that, I can't do that." And then finally once for my birthday I thought, I can do a one off, it'll be the only time we'll do it, just see how it goes. Scanlan and I did a podcast together, and every week we would do some new thing, and we're like fuck it, let's play D&D. We all did it and everybody got snake bit, and it's been the best thing that ever happened. To me at least.


Text us your move.


Hell chains.


Last one. Reckless.


I'll take some for the road. Just to hold.


Dogs. Shitting and ruining everything in our room.


You face planted on the couch.


Why? Because Tiberius can fly, why the hell did we give them the carpet? (laughter)


Does it also help that I'm also within the-- Oh, no, we took a short rest, which is an hour-- Okay. Good. The sword is the one thing?


On the outskirts of the island?


Okay. I'll put it as close as I can to it.


I'm on a horse. Am I within range of him?


They think we're customs and they're going to burn it!


With his son, yeah. My cousin.


You're joining other armies. You don't plan to fight Thordak on your own?


You know well that my heart lies with them. Both of them. All of them. But I have put my faith in you. And I await your word.


So it blocks the light? All right, so go put this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only hope.


I'm sure they have other means of spying on us.


Oh man, I love this game.


And then we always gave Jarett a bonus because he was captain.


And then pop out and attack him, right from bugness.


I swiped from a few places.


There's 200 stairs?


Why is it important to bury it there?


It's a cloaker, because that was a cloaker's eye.


I'm ready for this.


60 feet. Am I close enough?


The three you just named?


Is that a 1d10 also? 1d10?


This is gonna go really poorly.


Grasping Vine is a bonus action, yo!


Well, I'll show Caleb around the room that I've already been in to see if he can find anything else.


You were putting on your boots?


Because it's night.


You should put it in the fire and see if it shows words.


I thought we talked about this. You told me-- and if you need to change it, change it-- But that I can only control him telepathically up to 100 feet, but could continue to see.


We should ask his name and be polite.


What do you know of General Krieg?


You okay over there?


Brother?


What sort of business contacts?


Can I meditate to see if I know anything about this--


Oh, where's Grog when you need him?


Yes, I am an archer.


We can rest for 30 minutes or an hour or so.


No, but I mean, it could be, we don't know.


I don't know what I am.


It's a little Pike cake!


How much is this one?!


Why does Scanlan never think I'm very cool? Why does he think that?


I speak Elven, so that's good. (laughter)


You were saying ideally, if we could get him away?


And according to the guards, these murders have been going on for the past few years, so it seems like whatever we're dealing with might have time to plan ahead. If he's been aware of the past few times that Tyrell has come through the town and could possibly know the next time he's coming through.


Those are all 12s, yes.


A heart.


I just got shat upon.


Yass!


(sings) Why can't we be friends?


That's kind of cute.


Monks?


Welcome to my last four months.


X-O Manowar? You are a nerd, dude, whoa! Are you coming on?


And just under my breath I say, "So fucking cool." (laughter)


How far up?


It's like 12% of a plan.


We're going to be windtalkers.


Maybe the barkeep?


Show her the lip.


We're going to stay here at least a day.


Yeah. Strength, advantage or just natural roll?


Just the juice?


What was that called again?


(yells) I try and match the Godzilla roar, it's not really as good, and I swing three times with my fire hammer.


I grunt at him. And ask what his name is. "Vex-'ah-lia."


It would be invaluable.


Yeah, I'm sure it smells delightful. Herbal.


I think you should just get all of them


Well, if I were going to do it, it would have already been done, now wouldn't it?


No, we have other ones, though.


Did he leave us anything?


Can I maybe sense a sick tree? You know what? Let's go to Whitestone. Let's go to Whitestone and drop some stuff off.


Do the Taylor Swift song.


I go and cast Pass Without a Trace on us.


You gave us the basics, though?


Temperature check, anything like that? Natural 20.


I think I'm good, thank you.


Snuggle Lord?!


Clarification  When Caleb did Detect Magic, did the circle in the center of the room glow at all? Or is it-- It's dead.


No, this is fantastic. And I run to the edge of the ship and I shoot a Daylight into the spell and throw a Create Water and make a rainbow over top of us.


That's too much, one at a time! How long has the forest been like this?


Oh no, look at his face, he looks like that is a very bad idea.


It's the duck rage.


Joey.


Only because it's under the Helm. Believe me, it's a nightmare in there if you look underneath.


Or wait, is that Jarett?


That's the first attack. And the second one-- 14.


Syldor sent us here because he said you would know what we might face in the Shademirk.


Oh, shark is going to attack one of the last tentacles, if it can get to it.


What are you doing here?


We got fog smoke!


Will you share your map with me for just one minute?


We're a party of 7 people just like, "Aw, damn it, you!"


Six, nine, ten.


And he's probably still inside the tree, and he probably is not gonna let go of his bow.


Reduced to...


Is it gargantuan? Gargantuan. Trust Travis on this one.


Dear heart, um--


If we're going to trust anyone, I think this is a good--


You'll be fine. This will be harrowing for you, but you'll be fine. We'll bring you back.


That's very considerate of you, Nott.


I'm going to give Vax a super detailed description. I don't know if it helps, but I know we can both cast Locate Object.


We'd like there to be. And you guys can tune in next week to Talks Machina, where we will have more info, more details.


Holy shit. You know, to a dumbass, that actually is convincing.


I think the de Rolos keep the castle, but I think we use the castle to--


Let's go in through the roof.


There's no entrances or exits?


Oh, that's still--


She is going to cast--


I mean if it used to be yours--


Sorry about that whole cloud mist thing, you guys. I was trying to--


I'm left.


You first or me first?


Lava tunnels? What, are you crazy?


You humble us all by comparison.


Oh my god. Ermagerd.


The book. What if it's just Lady Chatterley's Lover or something?


I think he sees this city as a ripe audience.


Possibly. One looks vaguely familiar, but there's something wrong. We should proceed-- let's go up and find out what's happening. Slowly, and armed.


Oh yeah, you can still do other things!


Are we going to just walk straight towards it then or maybe--?


We have heard everything that happened outside of this bubble. If it is wailing at us, I don't know what that would entail for us.


So the first one is 11 plus double this. 11 plus four, eight, 12, 15, 16, 22. So that's 44 plus--


Okay, can you check--


Because it's her strength?


Kind of like Fantasia?


Before we break through the door, I should yell something like, Pike, don't be so brave!


No, she's not raging.


Renewed undead strength?


It's Undercommon? Okay.


I draw my hand crossbow!


I'm blue!


Sacred Flame, save. You said dex?


No! I don't have anything! How far can I move, hasted?


Let's try to do some damage here, if we can.


(echoes) No, no, no, no.


I think Laura is the best healer we've ever had. (laughter)


That's a beautiful thing.


Oh yeah, can I look around? Perception.


I hold his hair back a little bit. His long black hair.


Can't hear Ashley at all. Liam is totally overpowering. I love it


That's not helpful. Charisma. Unless you make a decision in the next 30 seconds.


Okay, that was so good. Laura, come on. This is going great, guys! There's a lot of fail GIFs, right? There's fail GIFs everywhere, right? So why don't we do one where you're rolling a dice and oh, it sucked, or something like that, I don't know. Let's see that. (groaning)


Like parting for the queen at the Ren Faire?


No we didn't.


Here's a different one. This is a normal dagger.


Because you didn't use it before?


I think he is a fiend. I think he is feeding off her. The rest of it I'm not sure.


I thought they were, too. I thought the entrance was underwater.


Vex is going to put me in that pocket.


You have not seen me with my clothes off yet.


No, it's fine!


So we thought we would just trick them.


I run forward and give her a big hug.


Bigby's Hand.


I'm literally trying to read this and failing because of my friends.


Is she lying to me about being not invested?


Hey man, I know you guys all love Wyrmwood Gaming, but like this free-- the shipping is killing me. Well the good news is, if you use the code "critrole" you don't have to pay the shipping, you just pay the cost for the box and they send it to you.


If there's more in there, they're just going to come in here anyway.


11!


And now it's being used as a--


Do we perceive anything in here with us before going that far in, yes?


Festivities?


I have darkvision, now with a range of 60 feet.


Shirt after this one.


Well, they're holding the Horn of Orcus. Playing devil's advocate.


I know you are going to drag me over the coals for this request, and that is fine. I would like the dungeon master to fast forward to the part where you tell me if you will allow me to inspect the contents of this Haversack.


Tooma is not going to be pleased.


Me. Don't wake me.


I'm going to step away from the window.


We'll track them down, we'll find them, we'll kill them, and seek revenge.


How is my tree?


Red, white, green, black, blue was one of them at a time.


In the Keep, how about just stay in the Keep?


There's a rock.


Does it have any legs?


No, sorry. Over here.


Oh, I think this is your hair-dying robe now. Sorry.


This is the final one. There's more rejected ones, but I'll read you those another day.


I think I have some pocket bacon still.


Oh no. These trident things are really bad. Do you remember how bad they are?


Are you paying attention?


You can do a what?


Imps, imps.


Do we know what day it is today?


I apologize, I'm not very observant. I missed your name.


All right. We should keep heading on to Shadycreek then.


Tell them to come over here, but don't sting us.


We're friends now.


Yeah, we need to move. Sorry about your ears, grandpa! Then I smack the door with my hammer.


When we defeat the Briarwoods, you can come back and explore this room to your heart's content.


Ulog, this is not the point of why we're here in the moment. Stay focused. We can get your wife out later. Don't blow the whole operation because of your wife.


11. Acrobatics or athletics?


Oh! It's Darragh!


Lots of rules tonight, guys. Upper-level rules.


Oh. Who was your best--


What's the Daylight casting distance? Can you run forward and get close enough?


So why don't we destroy it?


Once again, do you still have Lord Tyrell's possessions?


While I'm in, you can build the trench.


I'm going to leap.


We miss you so much!


As Deuces and Shakäste come down the stairs, I say: Does this look bad to you?


Just Matt?


We can pull Matt's soul.


How many pages is that scroll? Is it endless?


He just completely took an expensive thing and left us to rot, pretty much, I think.


Right. So we all heard that?


Jester.


Maybe you could push it?


(whispers) Grog, there's a diamond up my butt.


Did we get it too because we were holding his hand?


Then I'll cast it again so that he's incorporated in it and I think we should try to stealth it.


Yeah, let's take his-- We take Grog's handcuffs out of his bag.


'Like' is a strong word.


Yeah, don't you remember? When we talked to him he said if we wanted to meet up with him to talk more, he was in Rexxentrum.


Yeah. But what are the things you collect?


What does your speech do, Keyleth, again?


He's on vacation. You'll have to excuse him.


Ooh, potion of climbing, nice.


Sir.


I still have it with me. Was I supposed to leave it behind?


Is that true? Oh god, that is awful.


Half the damage I receive, so yeah, I'm good. I'm golden.


I'm not supposed to know that. (groans)


That what? He's going to get help?


Where is your sister?


A music room! How regal!


Let him know that Overlord says he's in trouble. BeansyMccoy. "No, but seriously, I need a shirt that says 'how do you want to do this?'"


None of us debate that the Briarwoods and their circle should be allowed to go on. We all understand what they're capable of. We all understand that they need to be removed. But what we just saw goes beyond, and you're telling us that this is going to continue after the Briarwoods and their like are gone. What are we to look forward to, Percival? Where are we going?


Okay, we have to wait.


Piece of shit ability, is that what you mean?


They said they were looking for an artifact. Something that the wizards here had stolen? Something that they said furthered their bloodline and made sure that they furthered their population. I don't know. Do you know anything about it?


Oh, I know. 14. Oh wait, I get plus two on that other attack, whatever it was, it was--


To Jim!


We watched Galaxy Quest last night.


Even with advantage? Oh, fuck.


And then I see that the giant thing in front of me, right? Do I see the thing?


13 plus eight is 21.


Short and sweet.


No, it's not like a banishment. I can Plane Shift us wherever we want to go, to an alternate plane.


Can we hear her?


Do you want me to make an announcement, maybe?


Yeah, that was with ten.


The party is.


I mean, that actually would have covered everybody, the more you think about it.


"Kuthrek."


You have pan wiles?


Doo-agar.


Then the other one is a three. That does not hit either.


Because he runs into all the rooms first and he makes out with everybody.


At dawn, we brunch.


I'll go into my satchel and pull out some healing draught, and just-- ah, just take a big gulp.


That's better.


Okay. Well I'm from up the street kind of. I'm the daughter of the Ruby of the Sea. Do you work for any government officials?


I got this for you guys.


Just adding my wisdom?


Come on, Vex.


Did you sing with her?


You are astute. I say all that stuff out loud.


I'm just going to run up and go, "Yeah, get!" Go kick and just kick it real hard.


Maybe it's a one.


Well, I would theorize that perhaps their diet is 20% food and 80% diarrhea, so it's not very surprising that they explode into fecal matter.


You've got one chance to do something fucking amazing.


I'll run over and give her a big hug on her knees!


Reduced to half?


And the second one, the last one is a 30.


Let's hold on a second. It's been less than an hour. If I put my hand-- oh wait, no it hasn't.


3d10.


Not lend, give books to kids.


Okay. I want to stay anywhere on the boat where the storm is most visible, so I guess--


Do you know if we can stay here tonight?


19 times two, right, is 38. Plus the seven, so 46 for the first.


I bust out some of my clothes from the Fire Ashari. Go lighter.


Next to Keyleth, and cup her gently.


Are we all supposed to change our names?


Okay. (sighs) Hold on, sorry.


Don't worry. I've still got some tricks up my sleeve. Just wanted to make sure you're all right. Did they hurt you in any way?


This random character that I just created is really fucking cool.


We heard there was a council meeting.


Yasha, however--


I'm the second champion under Grog.


An arcane boutique.


Let's go get some incense! I need to buy some tarts.


Three years, never worked.


Oh, Vex, is there something you'd like to admit to the rest of the group? They'll see you use it sooner or later.


We want to pull up the anchor or are we moving yet?


Usually, in orgies like that, they don't let you stay unless (tongue clicking). You're part of it.


That is an excellent way to try and figure out what the fuck's going on in here.


We need to find the Briarwoods.


I'll go in if you need me to.


I'm going to try and fix this mess, for a minute.


I just recast it.


It was nothing. I'm always looking out for this group, though. Thank you.


We're back in the camp.


Which one of my ancestors did you just shame to death? Again?


We've been drinking.


Yeah, it's what you do.


I'll think about it. It seems like that has responsibilities.


Tiamat gave her 12. I'm going to give 18 to myself out of my healing pool.


I would've eventually looked it up. It's the sort of terribly boring thing I would do.


Come on, ninja!


Car face!


I rolled a four, so it's 37.


Well, we've seen it tiny.


Thank you, very kind of you. Don't ever do that again.


No, I didn't give it to him.


So we're back on home turf, right?


He's turning into a fish!


That's him shaking, it's not me. My puppetry work is amazing.


Wait, can he get through the mansion door?


You need healing like a mother. Don't shrug at me.


No. Just that I don't have any dice but I can use Orion's and they're going to be awesome.


(singing) Scanlan make you feel good.


Keep your eyes open. We trust your judgment.


All right, so first one is four. This is doubled, so that's 15 plus... 16, 21, 25, 28, 36 for the first.


I go into my bag and I've got some old, weird-- I've got a weird little--


It's very good work, I'm very impressed.


I'll just run over to Jester and give her a hug and just say: Case closed.


I'm trying to find passage to go somewhere.


No, that's the stick.


Wait until the sun sets right before they go to sleep.


I don't think she's coming.


That's 19, my armor class.


Write that shit down. Can Keyleth get up and walk past the diplomats' table and run my hands--


I know that, but he's a big, blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be--


Fuck you Gil, you haven't been good to me today.


I'm thrilled. We can still go underwater though, right?


The sockets glowed green and then I got hit.


Or to the god that is--


I also have the Batman. So we know he doesn't have a Batman, you know what it is. Thanks Robin. Useless. So I'm gonna guess that Bane has Harley Quinn.


I'm gonna try and scope it.


Yeah, I know, right? 18 for me.


Yeah! Sorry.


Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves?


We're taking Pike to Wilhand, I mean.


Wait, what? You didn't tell any of us that.


Is it faster than my heartbeat?


Huh? Ah!


I did the wrong-- We should-- Under's better.


It was a warp tube.


It was really pretty in there. People are kind of stupid, but I did talk to the Traveler, so everything's cool. Also, I don't have any money.


Clarota? Is this in any way dangerous?


Ugh, please be good.


Should we call you uncle?


No no no, the goliath.


If I were the heart of a tree, I'd be in the center.


All right. I'll step into the gigantic hole.


Hell has done something to you.


Yeah, we can. I guess I'll allow it.


Make it happen.


What are they going to do with it? It's a big head!


I will. I cast Cure Wounds on her.


Here we go again.


That's a long-ship--


Can we go in and look at the camp and see, like, stealthily--


-- and I understand that we crashed their website for donations--


We been there and we quickly retreated.


My boyfriend!


Oh, I'm stepping in it.


I'm going to spend another ki point and do flurry of blows and do two more hits.


I'm suddenly extremely jealous of Grog for coming up with that name. Oh man, yeah, that's going to haunt you, my friend.


We could go around Hupperdook way, or we could go Rexxentrum way.


Scanlan's gonna move right in front of where-- I believe that's Percy?


Maybe the white one will want to help kill Thordak with us.


I've had this hat for years.


Nott. If you get that sword, I'll give you my jade bracelet.


I don't care but now I feel guilty.


What if a non-spellcaster uses a wand? Nothing, right?


Well, we-- (sighs)-- discussed coming to a bigger town. It's going to be a little more difficult now. You can't go-- it was easier on outskirts, it was easier in farms, but we can't do that here.


Oh my god. I found so many amazing things, you guys.


I'm going to-- we're in for the night, yeah?


Was there a third guy?


Maybe you'll earn your way to that, we'll see.


That was the worst one you've ever said. (laughter)


We're in a pub!


All right, fine. 30. Very expensive.


They don't have watches yet.


Yeah, we're warping out.


I would like to cast Death Ward on myself. 4th-level spell slot.


At least it means he's regular.


I thought you said there was a--


So, can I jump up and then cast a spell?


Oh, we're the only three that aren't surprised. Oh, that sucks.


On jewels. That's okay.


Oh no, you're turning into water!


How did you get two?


Dust of Tracelessness?


I'm too far away. It's 30 feet.


So your daggers are going to do an extra 2d8 damage. And he's up against a wall, correct?


(coughing and choking)


And before she leaves, I say  Do a little tap dance, so I know, on the outside where the mansion is. I know where the mansion is, though.


Yeah. Because it probably blends in. Are they the same sort of shape as regular coins?


He's not even going where we would be going. We would be going to Whitestone, right? That's where the Briarwoods are.


I didn't! I didn't!


He's wearing it on his face. That's Strongjaw.


I did reckless, yeah. 18.


All right. One of them was fake.


'Cause he'll poof out into the fucking big guy again.


They don't know I shopped for everything at Home Goods, so joke's on them.


No hands! No paws!


Sending the cat to take a look--


Shush, you don't know anything, shut up.


Scanlan can hold his action.


Don't.


But we weren't in the Feywild, were we?


I noticed-- Percival.


South?


You need to put that shit in jail.


It's a very long barn.


That really seems right up your alley, buddy, but I think--


Described the research facility, the job to everybody.


Yeah, Percy got a vial of Greater Healing.


Am I within 30 feet?


Can we tag along? Do you need any help?


I have to be connected with the ground, I think.


All of the dice for this roll. Oh boy.


Are they all around us or are we off to the side?


Like the dude in the beginning of Aladdin?


Trixie's very wily.


We've rested.


He's not talking to himself. We all have earrings, he's talking to the others. If you were wondering.


I counted wrong.


First shot-- fuck it, I'm using the old die. I've already rolled two 20s on that one. First shot, I'm shooting to get Vax to drop his knives.


(Schwarzenegger accent) Yah, what's the matter, Dylan? You guys ate too many pretzels?


Any shops at all, or is it just--?


Okay. So he takes-- that's the wrong die. He-- ah! Oh, it's going as far as it possibly can. That is 19. Yeah. Ten and a nine.


So this is going over the firepit, past the wispy--


I'm just, you know--


Does that lead down probably?


No, you're right. We can't punish people who are just hired to do a job. It's fine.


No reactions, none of them.


I want all of it.


No you go first, you go first.


I wonder if it works on animals.


Through the horn of clarity or whatever. So it's 17.


You said with those nine people that are in the room, how many tables are there about?


Look, I feel like if we can get on land, at least, and some sort of landing party, we'll have a better shot. Nott, you're terrified of the water. I mean, we're on unfriendly ground. I don't mind trying to slip away or forcing our way out of this situation, but I sure would like a resolution and at least a better place to stage some sort of action than on an enemy boat.


It is so amazing.


I go puddle hopping!


Don't poke at me with a fork!


You mean a competitor in terms of sea space, or in terms of your faith?


We'll figure that out when we kill this guy, I guess.


For my share? Just my share.


I bought a couple barrels.


I don't feel inspired.


I think that's really expensive, actually.


Or any of the other terrible people who live in this town because there are terrible people in this town.


This tunnel goes in just one direction?


One day at a time. Ow!


Well, I've recently taken to travelling, which, very new experience for someone of my disposition, and I came across something interesting and I was curious if you had an opinion on what this is and how one might fix it. I pull out a broken sword.


I'm just saying, you have a responsibility now.


Let's carry on then.


I haven't gone yet.


No, I don't want to look at the dice. You're the DM. Whatever you say.


I need to go back there! Let's all go!


That was probably the ballsiest thing you've ever said.


Zanror? Did I hear you correctly before, that you have been the one speaking with the beast in the past?


Yep, I've got one more.


Yeah. Is there a Starbucks nearby?


That's my movement?


I don't need it. I'm okay. I know that you're very worried about me because of our love, but--


But you've still got the Witch Bolt wrapping around him, yeah?


Do I get a thing?


It needs to be empty the way it looks. We need to hop out now.


There was one time, for a 1, that it was a really funny bad fail, and that was when we were fighting the Dread Emperor.


I don't know if it's actually safe to just hang out in this dragon's lair.


What are you doing? (gasping)


Bearded Men, not Breaded Men.


And search for traps.


That's why I'm superstitious about my dice.


Bears climb!


Also, I lost a hitpoint when he flicked me in the nuts. Nothing? Nothing.


They've kept you in the Empire.


You're at a table, you're doing well. Eventually, you're going to want to walk away from the table.


That's so raven.


Let's find the crystals.


Did we roll initiative again?


Yeah, but all those guys, they were, I mean. They had strong attacks.


You know what? Fuck it. Should I do this?


I then take the velvet cloth and put it back over it and put it over and set it up as if I haven't talked to it.


What are your goals? Your goal is, what, to--?


I played with Mommy, and I played with Judd, and now I going to play with you. I will take a rain check on that. No thank you, Jester. It is tempting, but no.


"In case anybody gets hurt."


Oh, he's huge!


Swing, swing. I just get two attacks, right?


(shushing noises) This is important.


Go in there and kill him. Kill him, shit on his bed, and leave.


That's one. I'm gonna bring out a poster for you guys to sign that we'll put inside the promo kit with it.


Before it resets.


What abilities? (laughs)


It looks like a condomed penis.


If you reach your hand in it, can you touch the bottom of it?


Utugash!


When I say, hey, name your quote on the text thread, then you send in a quote, that means it's probably pretty solid.


I put out my hand and say, "I've heard a lot about you. It's nice to meet you."


That was sad for me because it was my idea but I had health problems at the time and I had to bow out, and I was very, very, very sad.


2d8. Oh, five damage to him. Dang it. Then I'm going to cast, for my bonus action, Spiritual Weapon!


Shit, I'm the worst at this!


And what would you request?


Really, oh fine.


Good thinking, Tiberius!


I can attempt to maybe revitalize your plant life as much as I can before I leave.


Yeah. I picked it up, right, because I was just going to carry it out, and it said, like: "I can grant you a wish. Any wish that you want."


Thank you. What are you smoking at the moment, by the way?


I wrote them down, it's not a big deal.


Around the world.


You said you'd lost some favor with people in power. I don't mean to pry, but would you mind sharing what happened?


It could block their view of us.


It smells like poop out here!


It could be the only thing that could break the stone!


Hell.


We're the worst Twitch streamers.


It gives you a plus two to your AC if you wear no armor and are using no shield.


Greater healing potion, yeah?


Are you good with puppies? Because this one's kind of special.


Terrible evil, the Baumbauchs.


I got this red feather from Nila-- and I don't know, when she handed it to me, she was like-- very deliberate on how she handed it to me. Will you just see if it's magic?


Okay, this is fire. My flame tongue dagger, I got two plus six is eight.


None.


What are their names?


No, but I mean, what if it makes us sad to be around it?


That's a good Laura.


I know. Are my eyes puffy?


Impressing me?


Scissors?


Hey, Brownie! What do you have to say about this place?


I'm sorry if we had selfish intentions.


It has to be attuned over a short rest, though.


Don't use Luck yet


What? You're crazy!


What if I were to channel divinity and try to make a prayer and be like, hey, can we come up there right quick?


So should we let one cart go first, and then?


I'm gonna give them-- nope, never mind. I'm not going to give them that, because that would be a terrible idea.


You've got this!


I'm going to go back there and do our traditional (bird call)


The jewels! It was what lowered the glass. Break the jewels!


But we know that Thordak is a total asshole-- Sorry. (laughter)


A charisma save? Is this magic?


We've got to figure out what we're doing with this thing.


Why can't I have your d8s?


Yes, he has character progression! (laughter)


Yeah, just you two.


Oh my god, that head shake afterwards.


The doors, always. This is Matt Mercer we're talking about.


I think you will be fine.


Clear the jam. And then set up for a fire shot. And I'm gonna take a fire shot. Am I at a disadvantage? (tinny electronic music)


No, like small on the inside.


Now I'm really worried about it, actually.


Just say, your messages, you put it  Your friends from the other night. That's it.


Come here, you. Tousle.


And another shot, same thing, sharpshooter. Fuck.


(whispering) Come to the side of the roof!


Honestly, I think just putting it in the biological--


Remember to go into the stomach, if it goes. We've got a relic in its stomach.


I come out of it and I-- Zombies. I start running towards the tent that I saw Jester peek out from under.


I killed it!


The other one is four points of damage.


It's got a massive cross beam supporting a giant arch structure.


You know, the kind of superstitious gamer that thinks that the color and style of dice actually makes any difference at all. The sort of weirdo who believes some dice are lucky and some are cursed. Or one of those crackpot shut-ins who uses dice jails-- ha ha ha. Those people are lame. Anyway, check them out at w-w-w-dot--


With a swim speed of 30!


Oh, 18.


That's a fucking miracle is what that is.


What happens if the contract that we magically signed doesn't ever come to fruition?


Yeah, I want to hear it.


I mean, only if we--


Did it?


How did we not have Pike with us this whole time?


And as he pulls me away, and I slovenly turn after him. I turn back for a second, and I completely sober up. Pelor has returned. Walked out.


Custom items?


Wait, we're in the tavern?


Yeah, yeah. I don't need to hear about it.


Intimidation is fine. I was trying to be kind of nice.


Is that what it says?


His watch is telling him he's working out.


Need to make some more money.


No, we're good. This potion will give you a silver tongue for an hour or so.


Do we need him?


I don't care what he looks like. I just want him back.


I'll also take a great heal potion? Is that what they're called? Not moderate.


Was he knocked prone?


Okay, so then we do--


Yes, you're moving.


It's better than Tragedy Candle, really, I mean that's a shite band, to be fair.


I don't fuck anything up with words, and I open the door.


There's a skeleton down here?


Well, we gave it to--


That's right, we switched that. Oh! It's just an ability I get to use now.


I don't know if you can.


Well, sir, I have some bad news for you. I hail from Emon, which has been attacked by chromatic dragons--


Well then, it's fine, I'll shift it closer--


I do not follow.


Yeah. We're having a talk.


I was hoping they would lose.


You said duty.


No, get some rest. I might need it in a bit, when this dies down.


Okay, that's fine. I have to totally rethink everything, so give me ten seconds. I will use my action to run forward and, with the edges of my coat, put out the burning papers.


That happened.


It's very much in his character.


That's wonderful. Well, thank you, thank you for your time.


Well, my last stop would be to the Water Ashari. In Aquas. Back on another continent.


Ah, fish, Nott.


Oh no, your weasel's dead again, isn't it?


You're asking everyone. Oh no.


And I, I just make sure that it's clean and put it back.


Sorry. Sorry again about that.


So 22 on the first.


Just the Plank King and Linus in that room, outside from Avantika?


Because we have a flying speed of 300 feet.


It'd be like carrying a--


(loud whisper) Yeah.


Can I shoot him?


The cloak--


That would be bad.


He saved the world, what more could we ask of anybody?


All set, let's go.


Have you worked anywhere else?


And you handed his ass to him?


Number two. Treant number two.


Oh, son of a bitch. I want to cast Faerie Fire in that direction, right where I see the glimmer.


So, vocal warm ups.


(singing) The love boat...


Are you close with her?


Wise.


Why are you cheerleading somebody?


So I'm just going to try and hold him.


That's a shame, because I wanted to get it back.


We have a keep there.


And Vex is the only one that can see it.


So that's 4d4.


That was a lot of action. What did you get?


And par-ty!


I also uncover my sword at this point, which gives off a little bit of light.


Much love Backblaze.


Like where did this really pretty pink and lavender cloak come from?


Okay, I move the mist to the next guy.


So Tiberius we're just waiting for you to awake. I think we should probably go and see the emperor, like you do. Talk about the little problem we have.


Do we know where she's staying, which room she's in?


So the one that I can see, hidden, I will try to throw Whisper. I'm going to hopefully sneak attack him and bamf there. That is a 28.


I'm going to say  Wake the fuck up! And I am going to-- can I hide? Is that what I do as my bonus?


Before we go in, are there any bits of whitestone on the ground, like stuff in chunks or small pieces or is it pretty clean-ish?


What's a mermaid?


Oh, you made it worse!


Yeah, so I'm far enough away from anything that I might need to fuck with.


I'm sorry for everything. And I give the pat, and head back to the table.


(yelling) Ah, damn it!


Ugh, goddamn it. Eight.


That's the island? That's where the island is, then?


It feels very strange for you two to be agreeing.


Oh, right. Poor little burning rats.


Yeah, he used Disguise Self.


Ja, good, cool. Super cool. Danke. Then I'm all done with all my shit.


Oh, hi. You remember me. I have a very important question. I won't take up much of your time. I pull out a small metal skull cap. Dented in a few places, rusted a bit, from the Underdark. What can you tell me about this?


Same, same. Me either. So far, so good, though, right?


Vorugal ain't shit!


Terrible, just terrible.


Maybe because you've been killing unarmed people?


Not on them.


(singing) Gern it all the way. I'm doing great!


Can you hide them under a cape?


You should try a different one.


I don't know what's happening!


What did you see?


Yes. I don't know. Either one of those is fine.


I feel that that was entirely coincidental. I'm really not sure that the two things were related. Something was wrong with this man.


Like one of us?


As I think you are all aware.


I'll cast Mage Hand.


Sure. Sounds good to me.


The pit boss over here disapproves.


That's very close.


It doesn't look that recent.


10 30 AM.


Well, several things actually. Several things bring us to the mine. My name, of course, is Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.


Which way's north, by the way?


Is it pitch black still? There's no--?


But it's a personal plane. It's my plane.


Would you rather be headed there or where you're heading?


Maybe the next one we can sign as somebody else.


Okay, so roll to stealth, right?


We should do this quickly before the light goes away, right?


Thank you. (laughter)


Just the kraken.


What happens on Monday nights?


Technically, it has to roll another wisdom save. It lasts for a minute, it's not per attack, actually.


(sighs) There's no way I can fire at the one who's far away from me right now, is there?


I will-- the man, the myth, and the legend, is true. So, in case you wanted to find out-- (laughter)


Heal is a 7th-level spell.


Yeah! I'm going to Sacred Flame him! He's got to roll dexterity over 14.


Oh yes, I do.


Whoa, that's good!


Is this considered the Berleben path?


Saline solution?


Grog! It's Keyleth.


But you don't have to stick to the road as an eagle.


Could you still eat the body? If you can't eat the body anymore then it's not a person.


All right, including ourselves? (laughter)


It'll be like a cold peppermint drink. It'll be good.


I want to see him roll an athletics check for that.


I give her an awkward side hug.


So, it's the realm of Dis and the leader is--


I got mine early, bitches!


Okay. Good enough.


And I would like to attack three times with my flaming warhammer.


For shits and giggles or what do you have in mind?


Okay, well, he's paralyzed.


Yeah. I think we all are.


But you've died twice. So--


Don't spend it all in one place, bruh.


It isn't that complicated.


Let's go wake him up!


I'm still fine, thanks to you.


Bastards!


So stylish.


You coughed up salt water, and you weren't even near the ocean. That feels like the ocean's real dangerous to me.


Beware, this is a no-win zone. Don't get too close.


In the water?


That is the crux of the matter.


I'd like to say, I feel pretty good about our casing mission.


Yeah, I do.


We can't do it.


Yeah. I don't-- groups and things--


Could it trace back to Ophelia, is that what you are saying?


Oh. Okay. Yeah, we self-corrected already.


If the current starts to pick up, we're going to fight it and try to go back, yes?


dndbeyond.com That's D-N-D not D-and-D. DnD. Get $10 off any book in the marketplace with code 'beginnings.' Also, Sam Riegel is a cock bag.


She's missing a lot of context on that sentence.


Right now, on geekandsundry.com.


We'll take a picture and text it to you.


I wanna flood in more water. Can I flood it more on this side, to where I try and-- or can I do something fancy, like a giant hand of the gods from the wave come up and--


Little bleed-through.


Water!


Vax flies around them.


Do we have to with this guy? He fucking-- look at him. He looks shifty.


Can I pull Nott up and roll over and hide on the rope? Or on the roof?


I think I can. I think I can, I will try.


Can I go ahead and on my-- I'm assuming I have spigots in my room? We're each in individual rooms with our own spigots?


I have a weird question, and I apologize for it. The spell I used to get away, it-- I wasn't there for as long as you thought I was. I missed how everything ended in the end. I hate to ask, but I was long gone before anything really started to go down. How did everything end? Can you just-- I'll explain why in a moment.


Gold armor? Or wasn't that the one at Krieg's house?


I know, and then you call the mom?


"Did I say I was sorry?"


Save?


I get advantage now. Oh, fuck. Ten.


How big is this room?


We're good at that.


Seriously, no whammies this time, please. Fuck! So that's a 16.


Oh, I didn't know that.


Yeah, I'm going to be like, fuck! I'm going to elbow her right in the temple and try and knock her out.


You can do four level-1 spells. You can do one level-4 spell. You can do two level-2 spells.


With your rage?


Send him back to bed? You should let that guy go for leave for medical absence, that's rough, man.


Why here though? Why all these shipwrecks here? Especially if Sabian planted a bomb on your ship, that's not because of natural causes; is there something about this area that freaks people out or something?


Yeah, but it's on fire.


I scoop up a little bit of dirt and I put the dirt in the jug.


Yes, we are going into the lava tunnel.


I try to open it.


Let's see if Caleb and his little friend are downstairs first. He has tricks after all.


No, remember? You looked at this before.


We've been sitting drinking, right?


I'm holding my turn.


This is what happens when we don't have any direction.


A six?


I'm not familiar with that. What is that?


That's some pre-stream stuff, everybody.


So he was just out there in a girdle.


Oh, I said it's perfect for us.


I have a rather large bed, if Kaylie would like to take that. I could sleep on the floor. That's fine.


Someone else may get to it, or something might happen.


So we head into the mansion.


Sam, you can do this to me too.


He's opening a cloak factory.


No no no, how are we, like--


I don't think so. No, that's mine. As a token to remember you by.


Shh.


Nine hit points?


I dare you not to eat it.


Hang on, wait. It's my proficiency bonus plus my-- because I was afraid that I had been fucking this up-- plus my wisdom, which is--


Oh, we're bringing out the moderate silverware.


I'm sitting on his unicorn stomach.


That is the smartest thing you've ever said.


Motherfucker. Who did it? Jester! My coi-- fuck. Fuck, I'm still hungover! Goddamn it!


Let's just get us out of here.


From where I am, can I recognize any of the book titles? Any of it?


I don't think he's a mermaid anymore.


Right, so we're going through the brushy moon?


Just a standard attack, or standard and bonus?


Before we start, how long has it been since we entered this chamber?


This is a reckoning!


It's breakfast.


A lot of-- at least all of our guards from Emon are in Syngorn, right?


Attack rolls.


I'm going to break off from this guy, and I'm going to rush towards Professor.


Hold on, I'm naked!


Oh no! It's on!


Oh, that's right, that's not-- okay, I'm sorry, I was confused.


Honestly, I can't tell from here. It's very localized.


I thought we were in our chamber.


Thank god you're not there!


We should just spend the next three hours in the storage room.


Not in my clan, no. But there was someone. I think I was telling you before that they give you a job as soon as you're able to do one. They tried me on so many different jobs. But I was not a soldier, I was not a good cook, I wasn't good at sewing or building. So they stuck me with the torturer.


That dragon's days are numbered.


We're fine. It's warm down here.


Let's stick it to Lady Briarwood again. Cool. Balls. Oh wait, do I, I don't need to roll to hit on that, right?


Captain Avantika and Jamedi, did you want to stay with us in the bubble?


What in the fuck is this place? How are you doing this?


Yeah, you are!


I wanna, I wanna build--


Power the trammel?


Tell it to the necromancer, pal.


Guiding Bolt is an attack thing, so I have to roll to attack.


I wonder if she knows the other hags that we've encountered.


What? There's a sunken boat in the lake.


The bastion of death is what we're trying to find.


Well, I mean, it was pretty public. Towers are tall.


Other than being Chains being on social media, people have also shouted he's very attractive and sexy, so maybe that's a selling point for you. So you should go watch it. It's out right now, his second episode is out this past Tuesday. Go watch him! He's funny, he's very charming.


It's a 19? I'm going to spend a grit point and say that doesn't hit.


No. It's not a cleric spell.


That's 14 points of damage.


You all probably remember this guy, Joel, the executive director from 826LA. Thank you so much for having us and talking to us once again. We've been doing this a few years now.


Did the muck try to eat you?


Okay. Can I heal somebody?


We have a bunch of allies. We can't just up and leave without at least saying, like, we're out.


That's all of the checks. So zero.


We'll check his study, and then we'll go.


Hey, 19!


I'll Hunter's Mark. I'll just dash. I'm just stupid.


But we've got to wait on Tary!


So Tary, Keyleth, Vex and I just decided on a drunken evening, we were like, we should open up a bakery!


That's Vecna.


Maybe come up with a landing point as well.


Sorry, yes?


I'm rolling so well.


She lit it up.


Is that who they were talking about today? The group?


Does he have an actual name or is that just his name?


I'm going to let you guys take the lead on this. I'm more of a spectator, at this point.


Just know somehow that this is a metaphor.


And I'm Beau.


It was fun. And we're gonna be back this week with our next episode. We're actually gonna be talking about a lot of things, including characters with mental health issues in comic books, both superhero and otherwise. Including Legion, from the X-Men, who has currently got a show on FX which is magical.


I think we just need to get closer.


While I'm in the tree, can I do something?


Sometimes the people that help you are the least expected.


I'm going to chuck Whisper at it.


Yeah, sure. We're kind of in the middle of a short rest anyways.


You're paying for his entry?


I'm trailing him.


Backing up towards the cart, jogging backwards.


If it's more or less on the way then yeah, we can at least swing by.


That's super tight.


Okay, you're a good person.


I take out my flute and I play a little Healing Words spell and try to heal him of his drunkenness.


I just walk all the way over to the corner, stealthing.


Just a bunch of sexual innuendo, Matt.


Technology? What's it all about?


I can move first, right?


Oh, it's just a stick.


Northeastern direction.


Oh yeah, about to smash you.


Oh. Do you want 'em back?


Yeah. May his soul rest. And he had doubts. And he let them inform his decisions, and tried to do what was right. And the questions you have, I think they speak to your character.


Material? It's the carpet!


I cast a Create Water spell so we can all have some water.


Lift, lift, lift. (laughter)


What a button on the night! (laughter)


I want to see if there's any markings or anything otherwise that I would expect to see.


Two strikes or one strike?


Danger-zone. I swear.


Professor.


Oh dear god. Okay. I'm going to transmute the earth underneath him. Right? That's what I'm doing? That's part of the plan? So if I can do right underneath Umbrasyl, that would be fabulous.


4th-level Banishment on Scanlan?


Well done, Nott.


It really depends on what you have at your disposal. Yeah?


Using my cantrips--


(silly voice) Okay. 11-- Fucking shit. 11 plus four lightning damage and then-- Ugh! I'm going to fucking Hunter's Mark him, motherfucker, because I forgot to do it.


Thereabouts, yes.


It was a joke! It was a fucking joke that the internet will take too seriously, I'm sure.


I'll head to the lighthouse.


Do I have some five o'clock shadow?


Yeah. We can just say on the way back from those visits, at night when I made camp, I want to summon the falchion and spend more time with it. Examine it, specifically the eye, if it has that sort of-- in the letter, it looked like there was a gash into the sphere itself. Does it represent that, is it smooth? Does it move?


Where is the hair from?


Who's in it? Matt, you're in it. Is it just Matt? Is that it? Who else is in it?


Just tell me when to start swinging the sword.


Hell yeah!


On our own?


I think this will do for our friend back up on the surface. Or under surface.


Technically speaking, we can't quite feel fear at the moment, can we? Or is it just a general malaise of fear? (all laugh)


That should stop it right there.


I can spend time essentially collapsing the whole thing.


You are happy?


I'll pull three out.


Never mind, I don't want to put you out. Anyone want to go see the Archive?


43.


I'm happy either way. Shit.


It's a nervous tic, really.


That's bad.


Yes, and Google Play, and yeah. The stuff like that.


The Balleater!


He's got no plans later. That could be really cool.


I think it's constitution. Constitution saving throw.


This is far greater than anything I could have hoped for.


Maybe the army's going to head to-- no, we could be so lucky if it was on its way to attack it.


I'm going to make sure her wounds were tended because she was pretty busted up.


I'm just saying! Sometimes the lack of information can be a process of elimination.


Oh. Yes, it's me, Bren. Yeah, I'll be right over.


I pull out the broom and I lift up in the air.


Well, I don't know if he's new, but he is just not well-known, especially here. I'm sure where he's from everybody knows him because he's really cool, so I bet a lot of people are like, "Oh my god, I love you!"


Just so thirsty.


Or ten spheres.


They're taking him home.


Well. Dragon came. Not happy. You'll be glad to know, however, that it took one of your Herd away with it.


You all right? You feeling all right?


He's fallen for that stuff before.


Whoa, fuck yeah!


My dear friend?


And I attack.


I'm going to use Message to communicate to Grog: If there was ever a time for a prank, now is it.


(distorted, vibrational voice) This is really cool! (all laugh)


That's a one. If I'm hasted, can I do two potions? Instead of attack, attack, attack.


Yeah. (laughing)


Now. Would anyone like a fortune read?


Oh, I was going to ask for her.


No one. The horses.


Lucius.


You can buy my vote.


Over the top of the ruins, can I see the hellish toad?


Maybe I should too, because, you know, I'm watery now.


So am I touching the hammer right now? But it's not a magic hammer, it's just a really nice hammer.


You have, I'm speaking very quietly amongst Jester's whispers.


No, wait. Can we surround it first? Jesus.


Yeah. The suburbs of Yenkville.


She wants two shots, and so wait, are me and you doing the two and the--


Raven's Crest?


Zartana.


What are we fucking pretending like--


Right. And what about Kevdak?


It's a wand, so I'm using three charges. It's 10d6.


Burns your eyes a little bit.


Yes, I think...


Are you not scrying on a tree?


(speaking Undercommon)


Ooh, yes, I would like the same thing.


I've seen enough. We should keep going. (group laughs) This map says that there's an elevator a short ways up.


They have a vulnerability to poppyseed muffins.


You have a sword that can teleport you. You could bamf up onto the walkway with them and knock one off, and we could kill him.


What, you don't like berries?


Not a natural 20. Total.


None of us knew about the crow's nest person.


Can I check for traps as I go?


I mean we have no need for a ship.


Is he within 30 feet of me? Wait, no! I can cast this on myself, can't I?


Oh, that's a yes.


Is he wearing like a Lolita hat? Is that what's going on?


Oh, nice. What a joy!


This is so exciting.


Land's Stride isn't on any of my pieces of paper. Oh, wait. Here it is. Moving through non-magical difficult terrain costs you no movement.


We're kind of going from town to town and asking as we go. Afraid we don't know too much.


It was purple flavor.


Can I stand up?


I'm bursting out a fog cloud, and then--


Yeah, that's what I was thinking, send him in.


Should've raged. That's not terrible. 24.


Bard!


I follow as well.


As the Crumbly, the little guy to Jabba the Hutt, for Vecna.


Yeah, I'll help.


All right, I'll take the other door.


Oh, check this out! (spits)


Hard to tell what motions you're doing.


Aren't you the least bit curious what a little drippy-drip might do? (background music)


You were staring at me, darling.


Of course! This is all free through the Geek and Sundry website.


Maybe that was it. Because I wouldn't want to send 5000 gold over the mail system. There's people out there who steal the mail!


That's what I'm doing.


(pained) Yeah, ah.


We've never done it before!


Everybody back?


(gasps) What is it that you want, knocking on our door so late at night, Caleb?


Go in at the same time.


Percy, I think you are the distraction. Are you going to be the distraction?


It's not the dick brush, it's the paintbrush!


Yes, we should go walk around.


You know what? We'll go after her. We'll bring her out. We'll get her out of your mines.


What else can we plug?


I'm sure we can find some charcoal.


Yeah, you're better than good, buddy.


Yeah. Sort of.


No. It's definitely an intruder.


Out of curiosity, what did you pick up, what did it look like?


Just remember, you either get the nickname "The Gentleman" because you are one, or because you're really not.


You'll find another room bathed in self-loathing. (laughter)


Okay, whatever you say, boss. That is a seven.


Good evening. Do you walk out the main door?


Oh, that is strange. Youthful exuberance, I suppose.


Yeah. Well, we can float down.


What? They're right here. Look behind me, you stupid. Okay.


We should leave Whitestone.


Saving throw? Oh right, because we've been in a cursed land for a while.


Okay. I'm going to use my lizard-brain and sniff out immediately Allura, and I'm going to go find her.


What does stone's endurance do?


I think we would need a proper smuggler for that.


Only trees she's seen and knows very well.


Only small, medium and 4XL are sold out right now. Everything else is still in there.


Ja. Okay, so what are we doing now?


Okay, so we swim up to the top and we come back to the shore and you're just in the water still. "Yes?"


I'm going to ask him to drop me, and I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds.


Tiberius. (caws) Sorry! He's more important. (caws)


I didn't level up! What a dick.


I command my servants to wipe our feet.


Just me!


Doubtful. What did you get?


Is he inside of you now?


Success all around! Did you learn anything, Vex and Vax?


I'll go next to Keyleth.


I mean, if it's a trap that can be sprung by something going in, maybe fish or maybe a humanoid, that would probably be good.


Oh, that would be bad.


Okay. Again, I'm not embarrassed.


I saw it from my window. It was a really, really, really big tentacle.


Yeah, can we move into the shadows?


I mean, what?


He would know. He would know.


I just want to use it for cover.


Okay. I'm a punching bag for this shit. Why don't you all wait here a minute. Wait.


I guess we're all going.


Yes, she does. Reckless for a straight roll.


No, I just had a tickle in my throat.


I wonder if the giant spider thing heard that.


I'm going to go down.


So many of them in New York and in San Francisco this week, where we've been all over the place.


Are we hoofing it? Are we flying?


I'm going to use three, I get three charges and then two more is five... yeah, five. Yes, five.


Okay, so what was Mr. Frogman's diet?


Yeah, that's good, that's a 27.


Any other healing potions to buy? Come on people.


Damage?!


Temple party. Who else is on temple party?


I say we tie it to a rock and drop the rock off a specific dock, and maybe we're lucky and it's still there later.


The gate was open, the side gate.


Oh, we look right, you look left.


No, just reckless attack. This one is with great weapon master. Nope. Better. 16 plus nine is 25, minus five is 20.


This is why the circus worked. This is why the circus was functional.


I think you need an ale.


Is there a counter in the shop?


All the way up and over?


Okay, 28 plus my 4d8 piercing damage. That's balls.


And do I still have movement now as myself?


Oh, that's true, you should study while we watch.


What have they brought?


I can say twice. And would probably explained how it happened, and what I did. It's just story time. Sometimes the questions get a little inappropriate.


Humanoids? What about humanoids?


Druid's doing interpretive dance again.


I take Scanlan by the scruff, and swing him down.


You are a plague. Your good fortune is a plague upon your friends.


Got it. Aw.


Avantika! Did you know he was dead?


We generally would if our party’s here. She just can’t tell us at this moment.


We're going to the southern tip.


But it didn't seem to give a shit?


Can we leave them a bit of water?


Inside the shop, has it grown or become more ornate since we've last been here?


Shiny fingernails.


This is like old animation where it just repeats and repeats and repeats.


I want to see if it works.


Buying it dinner.


Are we that obvious?


I can do two things. We can send Frumpkin into the air and--


As we're walking out, I will show you a trick that I've learned in the past few years. It's very cold out. I pull sides of the bread out. It's hot. I hand to you a bread, and I hand you a piece of bread, and then I shove my hands in. It's warm, and I can eat it later! Let's go.


All right. I'm going to Pokeball Grog right out so he can attack straight out of the gate. Just like I would Cannonball Trinket.


It can't be for anything else. Anything else won't compare. Just change it.


Yeah, I want to help block it.


Hey! Hello? We saw you.


Yeah, 17.


Shit. I'll turn and head towards other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my bonus action to cast Hex on it.


Love you, Matt.


Sure. I guess. What are you searching for?


Oh shit, I just rolled off the table. How did I do that? 16.


And we can't do anything?


Right. I won't take up too much more of your time, but if I could ask you one last thing. Aside from the Slayer's Take and the Trial Forge, if you had to find men at arms, men to attack a very large foe, possibly quite dangerous, where would you go?


Laura doesn't shit!


I've had 12 months of downtime to figure my shit out. My armor is tight now.


I think this is actually going far better than I had hoped.


And my stealth is two, so that's 17.


He healed us all up before we left, right?


But the gangplank is holding us on?


Do you tip them?


But she can hear my little whisper?


I think I called him U-tu-gash, because that's what I wrote down.


Oh. Oh, you suddenly lied to us. Wow, I feel so shocked.


Not needed. 29.


I could cast Invisibility and Fly, I could fly us all somewhere.


She needs help. Scanlan, come here.


Do I have sneak attack on him, at all? Marisha is next to him.


Yeah. But I probably couldn't take you.


Du, Du mas! Du mas mich!


Do you get along well with them?


I go up to the kitchen and look for something to eat.


Then I'm going to quicken spell and spend two more sorcery points to cast-- well, I'm going to look over. Can I see where Vax and him are coming?


We could just kick his ass, intimidate the shit out of him. Tell him he's not to fuck with you anymore.


It'd look even better with the golden snake thing. I mean the whole thing comes together nicely.


Come on, man, not some sucky stuff. Ah! Not bad, 15.


That ends my turn.


Yeah, I'm fucking with you. You reckon you need to apologize?


Brooklyn?


What are you talking about? Accents are your strong suit. You're really good at it, Fjord!


How tall is he?


I'm sure.


Firing again.


Because that's pretty cool.


Please, save us from this moral dilemma!


I just failed two death saves from that pun.


Can I use my action to pick up my buddy Pike, and I'm going to try and throw her as far as I can towards where Vex's body is laying.


So wait. They've changed their boxes and their logos. I don't know if you guys noticed.


Let's keep going.


What? Mom? (screams and flails)


You know, it kind of works.


I walk away from the bar and stand near the door entrance.


We were right there at the end, we were at the finish line.


Look at that.


Per dragon's tooth? Or for all six dragon teeth?


Also, we're mostly nice people, but I'm pretty sure Grog could crush him like an accordion. We're not going to do that, but we can set the terms of the favor a little bit.


I'm going to give him a little pop and seed him for later.


Fuck! I shouldn't have even said my god damn-- god damn it!


I helped, a bit.


All right, I hang back just a little bit to collect myself. Just try to dry my eyes, and I say to Doty: Doty, just delete most of that last chapter--


Yeah, right, fine. The first one of you that brings me a cow wins.


I don't get advantage anymore, right?


Okay. Natural 20.


It wasn't a favor, though. You guys are the only friends I've ever had. Most people in my life just leave. Anyone I'm not driving away. I guess I should probably try and start keeping people around at this point.


If you get near the fence, I'm going to try and jump on top of the fence.


No, no, remember you killed that kid one time.


The Iron Shepherds aren't there?


Vox Machina is dead, long live Vox Machina.


It needs dónde está la biblioteca?


So we had to come up with something less provocative.


Yes! Hi everybody. Okay, so. Boonzy Arts-- they make geeky candles. They have a Kickstarter right now called Wheel of Flame, and they're making essentially DND thematic immersive candles that smell like the environments that you're in! This one is Dragon's Lair and it's smoky and musky.


(strangled death noises)


Fuck! Now we're underwater with them?


Also, in honor of the twins.


If there's trouble.


I love that monologue.


I'm quite sure. Natural 20!


So we have a home here. We have rooms here. We don't have to pay for lodging?


Come on, don't do that again. You're my sister.


Passive income, right? It's the dream.


Someone with little gnome hands, maybe.


Wait, what? I thought I get them all.


Maybe tomorrow morning we can go spy on her house.


They call me Clay.


It's impossible to take you seriously.


I'm sorry we couldn't have been there to protect you from Zoen. What a dick. I mean, we were here all night fucking trashed, so-- If we had only been there.


Oh, I'm so happy right now.


And I'm throwing all of Cabal into it. So that's 1d10, sorry. I'm trying to do this. 1d10.


Because he's a traitorous bitch.


Burned it! Burn that shit!


Oh my gosh! How great because we came in--


This goes back to my conversation with you, which is: are we going to find a pocket and rest?


Is it a column or a stalagmite?


Damn it! All right.


I want to grab over his head, rip--


Fuck, never mind.


Very healthy.


No. I just want to make a ton of money and drink a lot of booze.


I'm going to find the most interesting, boisterous clientele in the bar and I'm going to approach them.


I think he's in the kitchen.


The cat!


We have cover from either side of the top. That's right. I'm going to fly over to the top of the far right of the ravine.


I'm flying right in his face.


Oh. To that purple devil. To Mollymauk Tealeaf.


I'm going to-- I'm going to not spend the ki point.


I have a question. Right now, where is the Lavorregard menagerie?


Oh, she was actually awake.


Ashley, what's going on with you? Anything to plug? Any other projects that you're working on?


Okay, yeah yeah, it's all you.


And 16 on the third.


I'm gonna look for a brothel! (all laugh)


Can you escort us to the tower? Dominate Person has got to be wearing off.


That is true. I did do something similar to Bellenore's face. But they will not give you purpose. You are better out of their shadow. Trust me, I know. You should find better purpose for yourself. Go. Be free. I doubt that they will trouble you any more.


That was a sentry.


Yeah, fuck that noise.


Planar Shift, I mean, yes. 7th-level.


The lead is just to protect this item from divination.


I know. The Slayer's Take is in desperate need. We should check on the sphinx.


We only got a C on our general inspection rating. (laughter)


I'm going to say. Two-Face can trade hands with Becca.


To bed!


I'm tapped. I can't do anything.


Nah. Let's get you a bow.


But he doesn't see me.


So you don't think he would hesitate in a second to turn on us?


It's like, covered with prunes, up and down the blade.


I don't know what I'm agreeing to.


We'll get back to you.


What was the headmaster's name?


Who would stab Waldock? That's terrible!


Okay. I'll sit down and I'll write a letter really fast that says, "The plan--"


It's made of petrified wood.


Can I move around the backside of him without him getting an attack of opportunity if I stay just as close as I am now? No?


How many of those symbols do we still have, and how many robes do we still have?


Winning friends!


You can't drink in real life and you still won't drink on graph paper.


Stop, stop.


Great. So the bonus action I will use to dash towards baby. And my final, hasted attack action, I will stay 30 feet away from the baby, though, in the air, and I will throw Whisper with my last, hasted action.


Do not send him packages of fish.


He stopped breathing! He's back there, didn't you see him?


Seven. Shit. That's persuasion, ten.


So I'm stuck here, am I?


Let me know when you are finished with it, and when it is time to retire it, I will make sure that it goes back to its resting place.


Correct, Taliesin Jaffe! Oh shit, I only rolled a three.


They don't like you? Why?


I'm going to use Vicious Mockery and just, you know: (demonic voice) You've got no arms, it's awful! It's a psychic attack.


Rolling really shitty tonight. Let's see what happens. Oh, that's good! That's much better. Straight perception? 30.


I know, but how much are we talking about?


Please don't write things down while I do that.


And I'm gonna cast lightning bolt at the thing. Who's wet from being in the water, yes? So electricity is gonna be pretty bad on him.


Oh. That could be good. Oh, that sounds fun!


Well, Vex, they could repair it; they have magicians here and stuff.


Yeah, you did look excited. I think you were excited that you thought it might be a beholder, and then it was.


Okay, I see him, and we have everybody now. I take off to the right.


There's not enough popcorn in the world for this.


16 and 11. That's 27.


All right. I leave, as well.


How did it go?


I want to know if you're within view of the guard with the dog's initial position.


Yep. Wizards of the Coast, page 304.


He's clean already.


While she's doing a nature check, I want to do Primeval Awareness and sense undead in the area. Within a mile of me.


Oh, fine.


So much lumber.


I was just thinking because it's at the same time, technically our moves. Could I send Trinket in?


I wouldn't send him any closer to the anvil, though.


It was terrible.


I'm right here! I can hear you all talking about me.


Can we get away from the mouth of the cave?


If you tell us--


Do you have a lisp in that show?


It's been a bad day for rolls. It's been bad day for rolling.


It's hard to find that out without seeming suspicious, isn't it?


I go into a frenzied rage and I rush the stone giant from behind. And I take aim at his right--


Pike, do you remember that spell you cast on Greyskull Keep when it got hit by the dragon? The thing you did--


I have ten of these? I'm shaking.


They said they wouldn't be bandits anymore, but they are bandits.


Are you talking about what I think you are talking about?


Do you want me to hold onto them?


That was not a play!


Let's take a breather. For a moment, collect ourselves.


Who the fuck are you?


Between Pike and I--


And so anyway, so, when I first met Aldor--


That's pretty cool, let's keep going then. Maybe we'll see something?


That was clutch.


Patchouli. (laughter)


Are there? I've only met one other person named Beau.


All right! How close can I get to this guy?


Ren Sutan.


I got you. I got it right here.


Oh ho, it echoes in the pot. (all laugh) But I start laughing to myself. (silly laughter)


Melt them down into each of the three.


Every round.


Doesn't have resistance to that, right?


(clunk clunk) To the edge, there. How far down is it?


What if we take shifts with the eagles?


It's coming across the border. It's real good.


Oh. How can you promise that?


No, I've only seen that guy.


So, probably safer.


So that's it for the big houses, right? Just the castle.


12-ish feet tall. Doubles it. Your weight is eight times its normal weight.


Yeah, look at that. Oh, wow.


Bong rip this shit!


Six months.


No stealth.


I like marmalade.


How cold is it out?


Nice. It's like a magic shield.


Okay, and I didn't overhear, okay.


Don't kill J'mon.


It's everywhere.


Scanlan feels the same way, don't you Scanlan?


Yeah. Is that magmous right now?


Okay, what were you trying to do when you brought Percy and Vex up here?


We have servants. It's fine.


They'll be here as well.


Well, he probably would've led his friends to us to kill us.


(click and knock the same pattern)


Oh my god, we're going to try and get it now?


You could try to do Greater Restoration on the sword to see if that would somehow free the soul from it or--


During all of that, I would have dragged you back here, brought you upstairs. And I whip off my ratty coat, throw it on the bed and sit down on the ground so that I'm eye level with you, Nott.


Can we go half a block away?


What if Fjord keeps Tiff busy-


Monstah! Kill him!


This is really uncomfortable.


Yeah, like we've heard tale and it's wonderful.


To match Vex, I give him one little blue feather, just off the side. Little blue streak.


But I didn't send mine off to be cleaned.


I saw, right next to the cut your own keys booth next to the dock, there was a rent-a-captain. He would sit there with a corncob pipe and he's like, "Argh, me is a--"


That's a 16 charisma.


Seahorse unicorns! Hold on, where's my other-- where the fuck are my d8s?


It's okay, it's okay.


Maybe you should cancel the order. Have him make something else.


Did I? You're technically correct, so go ahead.


Did the sound of clattering pans clatter outside?


I can clear the water as well.


This is my earring, by the way.


First of all, I'm going, Fuck yeah, baby! So is there anybody directly around Vecna right now? You're on his face?


It's like a piece of paper of the mind.


I imagine they are speaking of the previous owner of this temple.


Oh, I can too!


Oh, we're playing with that later.


I tuck her little body away and hope that it's safe, fucking shit balls. Can I fly back up?


"Yeah, okay. I'll put this away."


Can I see what he was drawing in the sand while we were over there?


Has spell equations in it? Okay.


I freak out running around the room. (screams)


Thinking of IKEA instructions.


I like dwarves. Did he have an axe?


You know, there might be a couple, if they're real good swimmers, they might make it? With severe burns. And psychological damage. But-- maybe?


I just got blasted. What's that thing I can do? I'm going to use a bonus action to do my little healing surge that I can do.


Four, six, eight, 12!


That's a 13?


Something respectable for a change!


And they're staying around for our questions.


And he wouldn't feel pissy if he saw one Grog do a magic trick and then the other Grog sprang up and said, "Fight me instead." It would seem more real.


I can Skype in. I'll try and Skype in. I'll see how much internet I can get on the island.


Yoink. What?


Yeah, I think that ship has sailed, Fjord.


Yeah! I'm going to let Caleb out from below. I'm assuming I could have heard Caleb going--


25 definitely hits.


Okay. Fucking hell.


I want to fly by and poof and keep going.


Blackened, charred wood on the outside of it in a sphere shape.


Whoa, with the whitewash on it.


...Marilyn?


While we've been sitting down there, I have not disguised the way I look. Any glances, looks, anybody we recognize? Anybody lingering on us?


Yeah. Okay, gives me advantage. So I have to do this individually for each one, correct?


I've never seen you in this light before. Your eyebrows. I want to lick them. They seem soft.


Ash-o-lee!


How long are you guys staying?


Yeah, that was my favorite fight. Just using the light, also we were shooting, I was getting to shoot holes in the glass.


Yeah, it was going to be great.


Can I assist?


And it's hard spikes. Hard spikes and thorns.


I go like this, hah! I use two of my sorcerer points, and I cast Quicken Spell, and I look at the general, and I-- Because of my books I've been tampering with, I cast Blight on his eyes. Okay. 'Cause I wanna. (all laugh)


Finally, thank you. That is an 18.


You'll most likely be hearing from us, as well.


Oh I did, that's true.


I can fix this!


Are your people comfortable in these little huts and stuff, are we going to be safe tonight? Because I could assist us with slightly better shelter.


Blood Maledict to all fuck.


I made sure you saw it. I was yelling at you and making a fuss.


Does the skeleton go with him, or does it stay?


It.


I am curious what the Master of Secrets thinks. Asum?


I was hoping to never stop attempting to contact Vax through the temple of the Raven Queen.


I'm going to sit next to Caleb and watch it all happen.


Got one. I'm not you. I have one of each dice. (laughter)


We're shark-powered.


That's one shot. This is my last advantage shot. I'm going to take another advantage shot on him. Here we go.


What the fuck did you do?


It's five.


You're so far away.


Ten points of coffee damage.


No, me and Nott are going to go together. Okay, come on, Nott!


Unless we fly.


(whispering) I don't think he's telling the truth.


Lay it on.


I wanna head through the city, possibly in the direction of the cemetery.


Well, she's not currently at her ship. I'm assuming a lot of her valuable information is locked away in her captain's quarters somewhere on Tiffany's ship. If we can get the information to the next apricot tree, then do we need Tiffany anymore?


Even if I go all the way? Okay. How close can I get to him?


Do you think that Raven's Slumber is waterproof?


-- we should still be able to talk?


Seeker Asum, in your opinion, is it safer to try and heal him or to try and clear our name through the traditional legal means?


Paul was here.


We do need new gear.


Maybe they should arm wrestle for it.


Have you dropped the body yet?


This is Nott. She's very very brave, even though she's very small. Be careful of your rings.


As Bouldergut is walking over, holding a pick, or what?


Just give it a rest.


(whispering) It's not great, though.


Wait, is that tomorrow? No.


Can you do this? Can you do this, Desmond?


The rogue did blow it!


Grog! Get your head back inside.


No, the weasel's staying with me. I know, it's such a temptation.


That's okay. 15.


I have no idea. I think I really miss my family. I think I miss my sisters and my parents. I think I was going to be a clockmaker once. I haven't thought about that. There was a moment. Do you remember when we met?


Did they seem nice?


You know what? Fuck it. I'll use my last spell slot to cast Hypnotic Pattern. I will make it in the shape of the cat's eye sphere above the ship so that everyone can see it.


I didn't, certainly not. I just couldn't get in the door. Rather rude!


I'm going to walk over and plop down in front of her and say, you've backed a losing team. And that's not surprising, you having been through what you've been through. That's all gone now. Sylas is gone, Delilah is on death's door. Whitestone needs to be tended to and protected. Do you know anything that can help us save your birthright here and now?


Is it metal, did you say?


No, that was me he was doing that to.


I've got a head of hair in the way. Where'd you point?


There's flaming spikes on the field!


It is engraved in Elven on the inside, it's lovely.


The red and gold robes.


Ooh, that's a four, so eight points of damage.


I'll do that, and then straight up in the air.


Sorudin the Happy?


Oh, there's a golden snake, I forgot.


What if we're The Strong?


Or maybe there are birds on the other side of the wall.


Where would we sell such a thing like this?


I'm running.


Should I dip my bolts into it?


Yeah. I Plane Shift us to Vasselheim.


I'm putting the wings out now.


The water? Just happens. Us breathing water is good for 24 hours.


That's gonna hit. That's a 31 minus five is 26.


Can I go through and look around for any papers or documents that would point to anyone else that he was working for or selling to?


(weak laughter) I haven't had fun in a long time.


Oh. Well, hell. Eight.


Then you'd be down a spell.


Yeah, yep, the Ki'Nau.


Oh my god, she's got a pirate tri-corner hat?


God. Okay! Hand can't do anything else, right?


47, I didn't Hunter's Mark it.


Oh, that would have been better, then, huh?


He's asleep.


I should have gone for a Sharpshooter. That's 34 to hit, Jesus Christ.


I'm mad as hell! And I'm not going to take it anymore!


I'm at your disposal.


I will bonus dash around, just to look.


Wait. I'm furry, but I'm not Trinket. Jesus Christ.


All right. I'm going to swoop down and find a tree, where the five or six farmers are, and perch, see if Scanlan can get a good--


Oh there's Druvenlode! There's Max Load.


No, it's with my staff, I'm assuming, right? Unless I wanted to deck him in the face.


Percy's gunman was in the hallway.


I'm going to heal her up a little more.


I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it.


Yeah, you know, I went through a whole range of emotions because first I was going to try to hold it, but then the guy was dead, so I was like fuck it, I'll switch to a Fire Bolt, but then he grabbed Beau, so I am going to use the Glove of Blasting and cast Scorching Ray on it, because I can't reach for anything better.


It's right that way.


Oh! I've made a horrible mistake! (all laugh)


I suspect you've been here before.


Well then, I use my ranger skills to try to make it look like our tracks are hidden.


No, they will all die. Don't spare any of them.


What do you think, should we dig him up, or move on?


(whispers) Oh no. What if Marius dies?


A miracle.


And a hit is one point of piercing damage.


Bats.


This was supposed to be a weekend trip.


Oh, it's already that late.


It's not complicated, but I've got a good design, and it has two nifty things.


Is it difficult to use that silenced weapon of yours?


Fucking fuck! Seven.


All right, let's go back there. They don't like me, but let's go back there.


Retali-tali-tah?


Big man?


15, 15.


Don't do this.


Yes! Because your father forced you to do things.


Not in a long time.


It's kind of like the game show problem.


Just drop it in passing.


We don't know yet, but we will be returning here.


A quick query. We're, like, visitors. We don't really have a place to stay. Now that we're yours, do you have like a broom cupboard?


Do you need water?


I go up and I push it.


Plus three, yeah.


Oh that's great. That's huge. Wow. Healer.


I mean, we can stay and keep getting day-drunk.


Greater Restoration kills Modify Memory.


All right, fair enough.


It's like Stargate.


No, it fires electricity.


How far is Port Damali from here, roughly?


Is that an apothecary? Do you have an apothecary here?


This can come in handy in all sorts of ways.


We can start heading back in our direction at the very least. Get further away from--


Sleep arrow first.


What is he saying? I mean you, you're a girl. What is she saying? Shit. That's really hard to remember now.


Gail, why didn't you do your report on First Ladies?


Tinker?


Can you try and pick this?


Do you have a holy symbol?


Is it Hold Person, or Hold Monster?


Is it like a militia that they're forming?


That's not true? I don't know.


Aw, dang it!


Great weapon master.


Let's go find my armor. I'm going to go look around for it.


For god's sake.


The Scaled Tyrant. They call her the Queen. She's the Queen of Dragons. Five draconic heads represent her, and that kind of thing.


630 each, 630 for Scanlan, as he is not here to do it. Why, yes, Scanlan. I will take your share. Thank you. I noticed Vanessa has some cookies on her desk. Would somebody hand me one of Vanessa's cookies? Thank you.


When you scroll your cursor over it, though, the descriptions are all in red.


Lovely. That will be so fun.


Combat. Here we go! This is the real deal.


No, your d20, which one was it?


I would like you to meditate upon who is responsible for this.


And I don't go up again until 26. Right? On the evens.


Oh, good times.


Cheerleader boost.


We have to go to that shop, Molly.


I make sure Trinket's out of the necklace.


No good at these.


Let's get some food.


They're both handicapped, aren't they?


Hey, can I use Luck for initiative?


Your thing?!


What is she doing right now? She still watching us?


A town hall thing?


Okay. Pressing my hand, just to see if I can check any for traps.


Don't --


No, it's fruit! Souls don't grow on trees.


All possibilities, yeah.


But if I leave, he's going to whack me.


That was cocked. 4 damage.


How do you know which diamonds are our diamonds?


You have that new Emmy smell.


I don’t know what that expression was.


Wine? Is there good wine?


You should row backwards too, Yasha.


Oh, and I will inspire Grog. (sings) This is the dawning of the age of a-Grog-ius. Age of a-Grog-ius. A-Grog-ius! (laughter)


If we're really going to be pulling out of this city that fast, haha. Maybe we should take advantage of these new badges we have and hit up the Tri-Spires.


Well, I can grant you that. Only if you promise to grant us respect in return, because I feel you were a little untrusting of what we were doing up front, which I once again understand.


That's what I want to-- Pendulum at him, yeah. I want to jump out and go, woo, woo!


For what? What's the plan here, man? You're really far away from anything fucking nice.


And I'm made of wind?


Okay. I'm going to Toll the Dead because he's been injured.


What? To sneak through the village to the tunnel? No! Not all seven of us. And a bear. Are you crazy? (all laugh)


Of course he would.


Yeah, I can move 40 feet, my speed. I'm pretty quick.


The Sour Nest is where the Iron Shepherds have camp.


Sure. We know a general sense of where we're going.


No. You just go. No, it's fine, you do it. Nope, you've got it. I'm fine. Have fun. Tell me how it goes.


(gasps) You are seriously. What?


I cleared Animus. Bad News is still out of commission. And that's my turn. Never mind.


So what if we kill you?


I'm sitting on half a chair.


What kind of ray was it?


As do I.


Grog, speaking of. How many health potions do you have? I feel like we might need to redistribute.


I sense my hour is coming to an end soon.


Hello, strangers!


It is true. And I certainly have, and if I did anything or said anything to make you feel lonely, I'm sorry. I really am. Fucking missed you, man.


Yeah. Do you naturally have the ability to feel that out of people?


Do we check the mansions for him?


Oh, Orentha.


Yes, a thing, we'll get to that, it's really not important right now. That's if we survive, that would be very important, but right now it's not.


Oh, yeah, Grog. You have the best voice of all of us.


Okay, now that we have you two together.


I'm going to stealth back.


Who are these guards? I wasn't next to anybody!


But meat tastes very, very good!


Ms. Yasha, though, you need to be careful. I mean, that thing was connected to the Scaled Tyrant and the cultists. If they find out what you've done, they'll come after you. But I want you to know I'll do whatever I can to stop them.


Can you tell me anything else about him that would maybe help? What does he look like?


Me and Percy are on the carpet.


Yeah, I guess we all settle in.


I think so. I mean, I haven't really looked at it too closely. Do you want to look at it with your knowledge?


Shit! Okay! It's a baby bottle, or maybe a rattle? What'd you say?


(muffled scream)


We know it's not dead dead. That it's just tainted.


Kill it! Flurry of Blows it!


I'm going to try to grab it.


What about snow cones?


That's what I really want. You know how little puppies, they crash into things when they're they're walking? Every time he poofs out, I just want--


Somebody was talking, having a moment. Then you draw a dick man.


Out of idle curiosity, why have you been trying to butter me up?


Two only? Do you have room for-- well, it's just six right now.


Okay, and then I am going to spend another ki point and do extract aspects.


Magic.


They all left, we were behind. This is the problem when everybody's thoughts are in different heads.


That's a dark dwarf. They're little fuckers, those are.


The Drowned Nest.


(announcer voice) Wha-Wha-Wheaton.


How big is it?


That's a nine.


Why would you want to hide your beautiful head?


33, 34, 35. Oh, LE Girl. How are you?


Draconic?


It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, we're going to be fine, we're going to be fine.


Or maybe not. It could be a backup.


Are you in there?!


What if we just tie the dress around our neck?


Well, I respect that. I just wanted to - before we bid adieu, I wanted - I can't believe we're leaving you again.


I can't believe we're fighting the fucking Briarwoods again!


Thorns.


Away from your friends, but back at the keep.


Yes, if you could.


We need to re-enchant it, is what's going on.


Ten minutes? That's more than enough time.


This is the work of a beaver.


But if we had an extra skin or something, we could trade it. We could give it away, so we should go get one, yeah?


I'm in that.


Can they vote many times?


I might have a hat for you. The other adventure didn't turn out so well, and I really want to give you this hat. I'm wondering-- fuck it, I don't have anything to say, take the fucking hat.


Is that it? I've done beer.


Can I look for Ukurat?


Get out of here, status thing.


Is it up to us?


Thanks for blocking my fucking shot!


I'm going to skip over across the upper level towards the far stairs so I can see it. I'm going to send my Spiritual Weapon over to it and smack it flat on the ground!


I just picked it as a backstory, I didn't know I'd need to know fucking anything about sailing! Jesus.


She's not really going to care about court so much as ripping the bones from your back. You really don't want to meet her. It's a bad thing. But yes! We can do a whole lot of stuff to get through the ghosts.


Is there anything else we want to do while we're here?


I can Grasping Vine one into the building, right into Grog's hands.


It just makes me so nervous.


Super soaker 250, super soaker 500, super soaker 1000. You remember those?


I'm doing Disintegrate. And it's 10d6 plus a d10, plus 40. Right? It's not the best roll, guys. There's a lot of small numbers here.


I added all my shit.


All right, that's eight points of damage.


Yeah, destroy. 23.


The best card is fucking gone. It is the best card, isn't it?


I probably have a little bit of movement left.


Come on!


Poison Spray.


Yeah, the Prime Trammel. Which we now have to get--


Oh. What a roller coaster. I was going up and then going back down. Thank you for your gaze, my lady.


Near it.


22 points of healing--


I have a feeling we're going to be down here a while.


What? Shut up, Liam.


Stray, yeah, a trek to--


But maybe it'll know how far away it is, even though it can only-- Does it work that way?


Of course, Captain. I am at your beck-and-call.


11 points of damage.


Okay, then I'm going to wait one second, not to look in those doors. But that happens. And then-- Yeah.


What's happening in the town? Are you leaving?


Damn right. (laughter)


It's 30.


Oh, okay. Just making sure that-- okay.


Stay on target.


A natural 20, so it hits no matter what.


Oh my god, you guys, we're going to die.


Yes! I missed this week because I realized, once again, that I'm supposed to be doing things other than playing D&D and actually working in the real world. So I missed this Wednesday Club, but I'll be back next week. I don't actually know what the subject is yet because I've done nothing other than this all week.


No, they're going to leave him. We've got one more of your-- This one, take him!


Get ready.


Because of the transformation.
