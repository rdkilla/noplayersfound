You know, I'm still working on the first one, but I love your establishment--


Hold on just a moment. Mind the gap.


I don't know what that is, but it sounds pretty fascinating.


--to me. Go, go, do your thing. Do your thing. I'm gone.


Was that opal?


His flesh is cold, but his heart still beats.


You look like a methhead.


Yeah, go for it. We've got a backup if there's something wrong.


Okay. Are these just dreams?


And what would you charge for those, sir?


Is he another 20 feet away?


Well, doh doh doh.


Trinket! I run.


What do you want to do when we're supposed to be keeping watch?


It's 30. Straight-up slashing.


You're just going to go down the hall?


This was some sort of burial ground.


Doubting Thomas.


17 plus-- 21. No. Is that right? Did I do that right?


The rusty Doty? (all laugh)


Oh no, he's trying to kill us. All right.


Oh my god, I hear two voices.


That was a good turn.


I would pay good money to have you explain how football works to me.


Like I said, greed.


He's eating him!


Why did you go try to be friends with that? What are you thinking?


Where can we go for food, Gilmore?


We'll pass it around. Everyone will see it. The audience will all see it. Thank you.


Yeah, well, he turned on me real fast. He seemed to know that what he was doing wasn't up to snuff. When I chased him above, he was at the bow of the ship, getting ready to exit or jump off. Obviously he knew what was coming next. Then the explosion went, and the last thing I saw was the ship as I was being thrown off.


Oh no. Roll well, my brother.


Matt, multiple people are asking what the music is that we're hearing on the show.


Oh no. You guys, you guys.


I have 138 hit points?


(singing) We're waiting to find out, but I'll be here for a minute now. Back to the game.


Oh, don't make that face.


Just go (inarticulate noise)--


Oh! No boots!


I have plus four to saves, if I have to roll a save.


What direction are they looking?


Worked for me.


You should take it.


So we have to stay within 60 feet. Of each other.


You can tell us later.


You said it right, it's "Ford."


An interpretive dance! (laughter)


He couldn't stand to face Laura.


Yasha, you should take it with them. Right now. It'll be fun.


I think she means your name.


Have a good evening.


Okay. The cart's coming, it gets slowed. "Oh, what the fuck's going on?"


Jarett. His last name?


Ooh. Bravo!


Bottom line-- and I touch Nott's shoulder, and I cast Blessing of the Trickster.


Is it one of those things where it passes off down the line, or is this rakshasa going to be pissed at both of them?


Can you do anything while you're paralyzed?


I'm backing up. I'm going to do my best to back up into the tomb right here.


No, I would just stab it.


What about the endless maze of the Abyss? That's another place that we're supposed to go.


The initiative is Grog, Pike, Vax right now.


Do you know what, Nott, if you want-- one idea, if you want to help, is you can also write a note in your Thieves’ Cant. It should be vague on details, but a message from the Myriad. Or don’t even get that specific, but write, in Thieves’ Cant, a note saying that everything is in place for the festival.


Do you want the--


But there's no Slow if there's Invisibility. Oh, but it's a scroll.


You should try sleeping on the floor. It's actually really good support.


I would like to bid on it, as well. Yeah, I have some money still--


Add ten! Because I cast Pass Without a Trace.


Is it really?


Sir Cadigan.


So the bridge is out?


God, was it a year and a half ago?


Do I see Merpol anywhere?


Do you know what's the blacksmith, if the-- where did I write it, it disappeared-- the Spark Hammer Smithing would still be open right now, or are they going to be closed?


Okay. You can still see? Everyone's good? You're up? Everyone's up?


Maybe we should go back to the circus. Scene of the crime? That whole thing?


Again, you can't get the smile off your face! It's etched in there permanently! You suck! Look at that.


As soon as he opened the door, I wanted to get a look inside of where he came out.


Tone17  "Another donation to a good cause to push karma in the party's favor."


Frumpkin would have been just 15 feet into the chamber.


That's the DM at work.


(gasps) That's right, it did! It saved her life.


I want to walk out towards our beast here and hold out my hand.


I'm going to investigate.


I want to take the rope and double-grab it around me and keep hauling ass up the stairs.


Does it sound... I mean, what would those names mean?


(singing) Just you wait. (cheering)


Okay, now I'm cold, too.


I will accept that.


They love holding hands?


Sure. Would three vials of acid be useful to us?


That's okay. That's a 28, man.


Fair trade.


I succeed.


Yeah, fin, fin. Land shark.


It will help me when I'm dying. That is true--


And slip on the ice.


Are you in fine form? Should I hit you until you--


We send Keg to distract. You go in--


Me and him?


That was impressive. If it weren't for Vax, you'd be my man.


The glasses make that weirdly threatening.


Oh, my turn?


So in addition to the 20?


Fuck. Balls. Shit. Mother bitch.


I'm sorry.


Eminem.


I'm taking a shot at him at the joint at his wing and I'm going to attempt to ground him.


I go over next to the illusion one.


South.


I thought we'd have time in the morning.


Are there any doors? No windows?


I just wanted to let you know that when I sort of sprung this title on you, I chose the Grey Hunt specifically. The Third House is easy, it's just land and title. It doesn't mean anything. As a child, the Grey Hunt was fascinating because it was a title that one earned. And I felt that you should have something like this that no one could do otherwise other than claim that you earned it. This is not something that can be given and you're going to be fine. I have complete faith.


(panicked stuttering) I'm going to drink from my flask.


Was he nice, or was he not nice?


What if one of the gods cannot see you underground?


I don't know if this can wait.


Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day, he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.


Yeah, we should totally be there.


We're all going to die. Wait. Have you gone yet? Liam, have you gone yet? Did you do anything?


Well don't give up! (cough) I walk out towards them. Do you have a privy? I think I shat myself.


Shaking down the pope.


I drop Frumpkin down the shoot.


Oh, well I rolled a one. So that's lovely.


I feel like we should.


You might get it ready, Nott. I feel like we're not getting anywhere here.


(sneezes)


I mean, sure, if you're getting rid of it anyway.


Years?


Two crits against you?


I roll 3d8.


Man. This feels like last game. 12.


I'll just stab him in his toes over and over and I'll say, this is what you get for separating me from my friends! Who I want to be around forever because I love them! Is this what we're supposed to do now, is this the thing?


How much is that glaive worth?


But he can still be enough of a distraction to get the guard to chase the dog while we get in if we can get the dog--


Once and this is now my second because it resets after a short rest.


There's the PB&J cart, it works fine.


All right. That is a 31.


1,034, presently.


Ugh, no, what is he doing to me? --from Origins Game Fair! Check out twitch.tv/DnDBeyond-- N, not &-- starting at 12:00 pm Eastern time, to catch interviews, the monthly D&D Beyon-- What?


I was hoping that you would know how to contact him directly, perhaps maybe have something that was tuned to his plane of existence, potentially.


You may not even hit Grog, necessarily.


We are going to attempt to examine the football, as it were. You can remain if you like. Are you curious yourself?


That's the guys that did The Order.


I also wanted to make sure that we were using the treasury, coordinating with Percy to open a library for the people to help them rebuild their place, which sounds like Vax is already on. I also commissioned a portrait of myself. I don't know if you-- I found a young artisan in town that I paid him some coin to paint me something that could possibly hang in the keep, at Greyskull, in the dining room.


Thank you. (sighs) It is exactly what I expect, I would assume.


So do you want to go now, or do you want to maybe swing by somewhere?


What were you saying?


How were his shoes?


Or Huppers?


Grog's girlfriend.


11 plus three.


Oh, somebody rolled this place.


Yeah, when I was getting the upload from Morpheus, did I see what the Core Anvil might look like? Or was it just like, I'm just hammering and Rambo 2 montage music is playing.


At night?


Just out into the-- "Oh fuck!" No, not at it. Nope.


Scanlan! Don't hurt the innocents!


Ten ten-foot cubes.


I'm okay. I'm all right.


It's every month, right? You can't toggle it, so it's something that keeps happening?


Ball bearings?


Oh, you did? We did not. What was he like? He? I'm assuming it was a he.


How much was in there?


Right. I know what I want to do here. Is Percy within 30 feet of me?


We get an extra hour.


I oddly trust that more than hiring someone from The Grudge Gang.


We have to get some handwriting samples, right? Of the Lord and the High-Richter, that way we can write letters, make it seem like they're--


Let's do it! Let's go through! Pow!


That's a 20. Not a natural, just a--


Double bear action!


She's out?


I have nice cups. Do you want a jewel-encrusted chalice?


So close. So very close.


They set my nerves at rest.


How are you with that sledgehammer on your back?


I can't do two spells at once, so I will give it up and I'll make my way to the door.


Ooh, it's tough man.


Each make an investigation.


d8.


A damn shame. I'm so sorry.


Wait. I ran 20 feet? 30 feet?


As he says this, I do a little cantrip Fog Cloud around Vax's... privies. Just a little floating fog cloud.


I know I'm getting more now, muzzbuzz.


I don't feel strongly about it.


It's happening.


Like an FAO Schwarz-size bear?


Well, you know, it's hazy because he's never really kicked to death, he's just kicked off of the material plane.


Yeah, we're still very awkward. At all times.


It just seems like she's into you, you know?


Ugh. Could be worse. 16.


That's actually really gross-looking.


A bargain.


Yasha had 16.


It's because we're going to sweep these Briarwoods under the carpet!


Right. That would be smart. What are we going to get-- are we doing-- wait. Here's a question I have. Do we have to give Dr. Dra the portion of what we found down there? Because technically it's not in the house. Technically. So, whatever we find in the house is what we give him a percentage of, yes? Yes?


You're not going to do the cloudy-eye thing when you're down in the meeting though, right?


Oh, yeah, well. Noja, Noja, is there a location where your spellbook was last? (belches)


We could use it in some way.


I don't have the strength to (grunts)?


What do we do about that?


Oh, he seems okay, I guess.


Oh, yes. Hell yes. I don't have anything.


(sighs) We've not been here many times. Are we surrounded by people? Are there people walking about?


We can learn what its vulnerabilities are.


Oi?


I'm going to scuttle up and look over.


Yeah, just like moving--


AAA discounts, tenth night free situation?


Do you have any books on how to learn how to start making your own potions? Or do you know of any classes in town where maybe I could sign up for like a potion workshop?


60 foot movement. It takes a couple feet to get to me, too, right?


Okay. I'm going to attack it. Oh, that's such a good roll.


Yeah, so we make our feast before we go to sleep.


I search him and look for any mark.


Hi. What's your name, darling?


You know, when she's nervous she aerates her bladder, all right?


No, but maybe we could--


How close to death's door is she?


The little winged thing?


Let's all agree that if this goes bad, we run.


I feel like that would be a really good idea. I feel like it might be a little noticeable to carry around a rug.


I understand. Fortunately, in this situation, you don't have much to lie about. You were here. You weren't at the Richter’s. You weren't involved in it in any way. The Knights of Requital are going to take the fall for this, that would be the only tie-in. Ulog is dead. You have a chance to do some real good here.


Why don't you make that bargain then--


All right, I back up. Fuck!


I go inspect them and see what's going on.


Pineapple!


Bonus action, I'm going to wrap him up with a Grasping Vine and try to restrain him.


Grog will take it back.


Should we go to the Grumpy Lily, then?


Eight. (all laugh)


Well, we did hear about that weird-- someone said that there's some priest or something, or cleric?


I take my flaming sword and do a few Jedi kid moves. When no one's looking, go (lightsaber noises).


I will reload and fire again!


Okay, I'm going to give him a level two Cure Wounds to get him going. That'd ought to heal him, right?


The hut, the hut.


Take the chains off.


The trigger mechanism is any weight shift. It's the same as a mousetrap. It's like you put pressure on it, you take pressure off of it, doesn't matter. As long as there's immediate weight shift in the platform, where the booty is, it just goes snap.


We got to go somewhere better.


Okay. That's fine.


Rolled it up like a carpet.


No, just me. Yeah, you fucks are still mobile.


It's a d10, yeah?


I thought you said ash.


My mother always said nothing in life is free.


I want to appear where Vex was before.


Quite a few will-o'-wisps.


We're going to the Alcove.


Wait what are all the doors by-the-by?


Quick, throw a price out!


That was the plan.


Wow! You have to do a Mr. Ed voice.


Three water passages and then two hallways that are dry?


All right, I'm going to brace against a wall.


That's what I would assume, is there must be some sort of underground structure, some part of the ruins.


In and out, ask him a few questions.


Did the happy ball of fun tricks come with us?


Prone and grappled, and not for a very long time.


(sighs) Okay. Including myself?


We're picking up armor.


Big 11.


I check for traps. Check for traps.


Are we going to do anything to the rest of them?


Pike, can I talk to you for a second?


Am I going to be able to keep up with he group?


I was so afraid it was going to be a one. 16.


Come on. There we go! 20 to hit.


Absolutely. Well, let's try our luck.


So much perception. 19.


Fuck, balls, tits, ass.


22 on the first arrow. 15 plus four is 19 on the second arrow. I'm a little upset right now. And then I'm going to shoot the third arrow through the Blazing Bowstring. I mean my second attack.


Why don't while we're gone you could help Hilda. Hilda?


Can I insight check if he's a man of his word?


That's okay. Trixie likes it in my pocket.


I imagine that depends on him.


C'mon, Beast Mode!


And my bonus action-- I would like to be very discouraged about my current state of affairs.


Do any of the beasts go back into them?


I feel like it's a misty night. It feels like a misty night, don't you think?


Oh man, I've got beads in that thing, baby. Got to be careful.


Oh shit! We should've kept him alive, you guys! Okay, okay, okay. Yes, Grog?


I'm going to start crawling along the floor and i'm going to cut myself a little bit on my neck. Since I'm used to it, I don't mind a little blood. I'm giving myself a good cut, maybe there'll be a little ice fleck. I don't know if I want to activate that, if it'll work on my fingernails, but what the fuck. I'm going to start crawling, leaving a trail of vomit into the next room, going, no! No!


All right. Follow Keg.


Aw. Can I have it? (laughs) Deflect missiles!


Triple advantage.


Ice shot.


Plus proficiency, 20.


Well, when I got my revenge on them, I learned a bit about what they were up to. They weren't really drug dealers. It's embarrassing, but the drugs they sold me were not real. I know that's hard to believe, but I was swindled by them.


Yeah, we survived and--


Ingots would be preferable, yes.


Doesn't always turn out well, Percival.


And inch past her. That's good. 29.


Another shot.


Tomorrow, we find some books!


Now he's getting out toys.


Did they laugh?


I'm a healer!


Oh, flanked by Grog. Yes.


Do I have advantage because people are chanting my name?


Caduceus is back!


Yeah, unfortunately, I can't-- I've never been there. And the Ashari are a very reclusive type people.


Harry Potter.


No, the one that I gave him.


Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind.


Should we retrieve the magic core or anything as proof of what we did here?


I will gladly look into it.


(whispers) Mention the Scalebearer.


You can even maybe call them friends, even?


Yeah, that seems like a little more fun.


Yep. They'll sink you like a stone.


And I stab him.


We're the TBDs.


Yeah, personal. Emotional.


Oh, yeah, no, I'm not having a good--


Hang on. Okay-- nope.


Should we go to Dolan's house?


I'll make a mansion for the night. We'll all take a rest and then go tomorrow.


You just have some paternal qualities. Just you know--


I don't need it. It jinxes me.


Let's do it and go!


So truthful.


Yeah, and then I had to act like, "No, look at the ground." It was terrible, fucking failed.


--but we are going to have an adventure, is that right?


I'm using my new sheet and I'm just confused, so yeah.


Grog, how did you do that?


But now I roll at disadvantage.


For up to a minute and a hundred foot radius, centered at a point...


I think I wanna keep it on. (group laughs)


Hey!


Yeah, we're walking inside.


Just close the windows.


Can I use Stone's Endurance?


Hold what still?


And she's like, well, deal with it! It's going to be awesome!


Well, I need to move it because the seal is under the rug.


Move it to the 10th.


Oh! Right, oh, I can cast it at higher.


We can't hear him so you'll have to talk. Hello?


Council members coming through.


Against you.


Start doing a little more healing on you.


Osh kosh magosh, it's time for hammers. Can I advance through the ring of fire and on him more?


Well, Keyleth is very confused as to why everyone seems to be avoiding each other. It's odd. Everyone's so standoffish. Anyway, Keyleth is going to go help the farmers and try and maybe help revitalize some of the land and help with planting crops, and helping out there. She also wants to make sure all the local kids are taken care of. Any kids that lost their parents in the rebellion. Lead the charge of making sure the kids are taken care of.


I'm going to make a-- the image of a beautiful woman briefly appear in the reflection of the object and then vanish. Just a gleam.


Oh, yes, get ten feet back, I should've said that already.


And he's a larger creature or smaller?


Would you be all right if we increased the Pelor temple here?


You go ahead and leave.


The whole race died off in a Calamity. They don't know what happened. Pike was the only one who was spared.


But now it's awake, so--


Come back here, baby.


Well, let's just send seven of us down for now.


Someone wrote it down, right?


I want to go now.


I thought that was cocked anyway, but yeah.


Yeah, what are you at?


What's our thing? Do we want to achieve anything else tonight or just rest?


Yeah, plan.


"I've got a reddit page open behind my DM screen."


I start eating.


That bowl is used for communicating with (nervous laugh) the mother of dragons.


He can do that when he's charmed?


I'm good. Warm blooded.


D-Roll's good.


Oh man, I'm so excited.


Then I will do a 5th-level Flaming Sphere.


Can I look everywhere except the tunnel with my darkvision?


So there's no way in or out, and every door is bad.


Get the other nipple, now?


We can go back to our old hideout. We have the tavern. No one's found it.


And we don't even know where to look. I mean, we could at least talk to the Ashari there. They might--


I was fighting a god. I didn't really catch his name.


You got inspiration!


I think Spiritual Weapon could make a lot of noise and call a lot of attention, and then maybe you could sneak through.


[inaudible]


I give a nod to Kima.


Are you a betting man, Percival?


You can moderate yourselves.


Oh, it's fine! We had so much fun and did shots of fire-something.


Is it possible to do it without hitting Grog?


Yeah, big scary dude.


No, no, Taliesin! Oh!


Would it be an armorer, or a blacksmith, or-- who works with dragonhide?


Because he's learning.


Right up to it. Could I get right behind-- No, I'll get right up to it, ja.


No, that's cool! We're here to clean up y'all's shit.


Didn't she just say not to--


What was her son's name?


But I wanna keep an eye out on the bar because I still don't trust our environment.


I do like pickles.


Enter Pa, a drunk. He smashes a beer bottle against the family cat.


He is here, technically.


A lovely moon hammer. I want you to have it. I want you to have it.


I'm not against that, but I think one person should stay out of the Feast and keep an eye in case they leave in the hour that we're feasting.


Can I test one out?


Just toss it, and then we'll come back for it. Behind a dumpster.


Shut the fuck up, gnome!


It's perfect. They'll enter 'Tary' and be disappointed.


Let's get this camp cleared and get these people inside Scanlan's love shack.


I ran a Rifts game as well in high school. Then I ran a game of Vampire the Masquerade, and I was in a bunch of them.


(garbled) Lame.


Why did he trip me and make me eat shit two months ago?


Yeah, I stay in the doorway. Actually no, I back-- well.


I'll be watching that! It's my favorite.


You've got to go to sleep.


I repeat him.


I point to her and whisper in my bit of copper wire and do a little hand gesture, and say all of that to her. The young one's bluffing! The old one's got a sick hand! He's going to burn you! Burn you good!


Yeah, I--


Here's the thing.


Hang on! Oh, that moved it! It was a 19 plus one. 24!


She believes in me. She tries to teach me to use my brain, which I don't do very often. She tries to teach me to learn from the world. And she always cheers me on, which not a lot of people do. I believe in her.


I will go ahead.


What game are you talking about? We don't have time for games, there are dragons that need dealing with.


(Grog voice) I would like to rage. (laughter)


The only one that's here.


Is that a concentration?


As much as anyone's a good guy here. They try not to get-- they try to prevent the innocent from getting killed or fucked over. Obviously, they're not particularly successful, but they're not under the thumb of any particular group.


Where's that corkscrew thing?


Okay. I look like a Tracy-- okay.


What was the name of the sword?


Should we go down there or should we stay up here?


Yeah, I've never heard of anything like that.


I'm going to step forward and inspire myself. (cheering)


Also another plane of existence.


Blends in with the sulfur; I don't care.


Oh. Why'd you say sure?


Oh, that's right. But does that restore memories?


Like maybe he turned--


So you heal eight points, Gern.


It keeps my poops nice and snug.


Yeah. Go around the back.


We're just going to walk around and see if we can sense where this bastion of death is.


Well, okay, I'm just gonna--


Are we still lit?


Ugh!


You're only two squares away.


Meant to do that.


I'm taking a long look at Cree and I want to see if I see any of the things that I expect to see.


Yes, right in the funny bone.


Then movement to clock right back around that corner of the--


How's it looking down there? Spirits high? (laughter)


Shank-shank-shank. Shank-shank-shank.


Something about Tiberius's brother.


I'm gonna keep point. I'm gonna stay at the back of the hallway, just in case.


I run over to the gold. I run around the worm and run to the gold. And I (yelling) frenzied rage-loot this shit!. Just hacking away at it!


I wouldn't have let her get that far back, I would've been hanging back there too.


Not just gold, you need diamonds?


Oh, you can just shoot, never mind.


Okay. How high is the ceiling in this tunnel?


Well, I'm really talented.


I poke my head between them. What are you doing?


I'm not topped off; I need four hit points.


Are we running?


Tolled.


I am going to be a beaver again. That's it. That's all I can do.


Are you really? Are you really? Where are you?


Did we already have one of those?


When you call it the stranger--


I'm trying. I'm very uncomfortable with human touch.


There it is.


Yeah, that's possible. This thing that I can do, this servant that I can make, It's not going to be able to open these things. It's very weak.


Didn't know the Incredible Hulk was in this motherfucker, did you?


Tune in next week for a shopping episode.


Probably ten bear claws. Also do you have any hot freshly baked bread?


I would love to try your tea.


So I'm putting that in the other pouch.


They're not tattoos?


Top of its turn?


Reverse math. We came from that direction precisely.


Few people do.


What could be that bad? I mean, if someone were to die, we could do a Resurrection spell.


You say he's not your son, but part of your clan?


Not a lie in that little soul of hers.


Why are we not talking about this?


If we hold, he just keeps moving--


I'm standing there like a catcher, ready.


That's very adequate.


I go first? All right. I'm going to come out of hiding. I'm going to fire an arrow with advantage.


That's why I said stay, but that's all right!


Uh-huh. Okay.


TheFallenTitan  "Loving CritRole, keep it up." Also, "Oh-ree-awn, are you going to make any more music videos with Alex Lewis?"


Oh, yeah. Well, lucky you! I also happen to have this awesome Magic Choker +1.


--It's April Fools', we're not going to be there.


Towards me. Oh, I got a thing still.


Do it. Fucking do it.


(laughs) What does that do?


Are the manacles trapped at all? I'm going to check for traps.


Yes, but she was probably going to the gala tonight.


Hang on, a little bit of preparation on our end, if you don't mind.


Do you get to hit him back as you run by, as your reaction?


Had a bit of a tussle. Guess what we're back for?


I'm going to drop a barlgura right on Vera's fucking head.


Oh, it's happening? It's happening. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I thought we already -


Bat-bear! Were-bat-bear! Batman.


Under the water?


That's true! You do have a people to rule. Both of you do.


Yes, Grog lights his blazing axe.


Yeah, he will jump up to any windowsill on the back of the house as well.


It's all right! It's all right!


It's not... Does it have anything to do with charm, or sleep, by any chance?


Yeah, absolutely.


And you're holding your action, Keyleth?


Keyleth is not. You are, and I am.


Okay. Hey, just wondering, a few questions. A: How does one get out of here? Is there a door to another plane?


No, she is who she is, baby. Just like you.


Nice to meet you. So, what do you like to do at night? Do you have a servant who brushes your hair, or do you just brush your own? No. Have you killed-- no.


And I go, and down.


You didn't see them! You were behind me, so shut up. What are you doing all the way over there, anyway?


Nobody's really low.


It went bad before.


I'm going to snap at him. I'm going to use Blood Maledict.


It's plus ten!


Should we go to this dingy tunnel?


I'll stay with you, but just behind you.


I donate the paper that The Gentleman gave me.


I mean, whatever that is.


You don't want to fuck with his beard!


He's a little bit high right now.


Who, what--


How much are those novelty checks?


Is there a way to navigate the sewer systems? Any markings we should look out for?


Oh my god, Matt! Why are you trying to kill her right when she gets here?!


Okay, I'm going to go to the pub.


I like the theory that he doesn't burst into laughter, he just holds the groan pain.


Is that with the weird "e" spelling?


Beautiful.


I've rolled all nine of my hit dice.


Jocks Machina!


It does actually make me feel better, thank you!


All right. Here's your gold. All of us pulled together. Now go sing your song! Wait, shake my hand because-- eww.


Might be a good trial run.


Pike.


87 episodes. One kill.


You as well, that Holy Avenger getting some action lately?


I thought-- wait, we--


Someone needs to cast a 3rd-level spell on it.


Hold on, are you saying you don't hear anything right now?


It gives me plus two to my AC.


Don't mind that.


Yes, Keyleth. Where is the flying carpet?


I'm going to the door, then, I can hear that. Inside the door, inside the door.


We've got to go somewhere else.


They're terrible guards. They make horrible life choices. They're in the wrong line of work. I take two chalices and I throw it in their laps. Cool. Now I need you to vomit on them.


He was in blue, his gauntlets were dipped in blue.


To hide all the sweat stains on his undershirt? I don't know! It's just weird, right? Like he's always sweating?


I'm a very prolific reader. And I've never read of worgs other than in that circumstance.


Unless there's a window. Unless there's an open passage on the back of one of those houses.


Do we have a net?


They looked a little dead-ish.


I'm using it. It takes ten minutes, and you can be as obtuse as you like. You can be a bird that flies in a direction, an insect, or whatever.


Okay, more for us.


Thank you. 1d10 plus four. That is a ten plus four, 14.


I start off. Come back and tug. (whispers) Jenga.


50?


We look almost exactly the same -


I'm dialing it in still. (vocalizes trying to find Nott's voice)


All right, is there anyone else in the party who could help us with stealth, or anything?


Can we each take a little bit of time to look more like commoners?


Trinket peed on him? Well, that's pretty good. I feel like there's more revenge to be had, but you know what? We're on vacation.


Cool!


It didn't hit anything. It's not even covered with any guts.


We're definitely going now.


Shit, shit, shit.


I'm a bit tired. I'm so sorry.


Yeah? I mean, you want us to do it now, yeah?


Does it look fancy? Is it magic?


That's what you wanted, I thought!


We're all going to stare at you while you do this.


I'll move forward a bit.


Okay. And then there's nothing I can do from there, right?


Nothing. Six.


You want another beret?


(gasps) Caleb, you found the bowl! I'm so proud of you.


You know what that is?


I swat him on the side of the face.


How about a chocolate-covered mallomar?


"It's true. And dust ebola is the second leading cause of death in the dust bowl. My rear end just can't stand this dusty dust. Deadly dust."


That's what I'm going to be aiming at, darling.


Yes. Just keep your cloak really tight on you, okay?


We're gonna charge in there.


I'll move forward ten feet, and, with my bonus action, cast Hex on him for strength checks.


We'll have to heal in battle, if we need to.


You are very different from them.


Let's, just for fun, I'm going to have some of our hemp rope already tied around this rock, with just a big mess of it ready to go, so if we need it, we've already got one anchor point.


We've been down here for days! (laughter)


Frumpkin is alive!


I would have definitely suggested leaving her with one of the stones.


Aren't we supposed to be doing something really like--


I love the haikus!


Do they have a reputation of being--


You have advantage. No, wait, that's saving throws. Never mind.


Ooh. 28 to hit.


No, I'm rolling my three dice.


This show is breaking apart because of you, Sam!


That's all right. I flip the daggers over, and I start to whale on the back of Keyleth's head.


You get bonus actions all the time.


Does her face look like--


We're going to get them, but what do we do?


Well, we're talking about building an army.


I saw one of those in Antioch once


It's still a foot?


Curly.


I'm going to do the same thing.


This is so embarrassing! Wow! (laughter)


I think we have to go back to the inn, right?


I can make her invisible.


He's going to take 15 percent of your hit points.


It's time.


You can climb up. Yeah, you're a monk, you can climb up to the ceiling. Hey, Mama?


That's okay! (slurred) Just going to do it again.


Showing up just to get arrested!


At one point there was Fjord and Caleb.


I don't understand what any of this is anymore.


Thank you. Where do we want to dump him in the ocean again for a look around?


Where do we go?


I gathered some stuff.


You buy your own issue. Whatever you've got a problem with, you can buy it yourself. This is not where my coin is going. And anything that smells nice, just whatever.


Well, clearly it wasn't!


Why don't you just use your fucking earring?


I head to rest. He gave me permission to.


26. No, wait. Yeah, 26.


(exploding noises) Oh shit.


Make it acid damage. (laughter)


Does she get advantage on barrels because she's a cooper?


Can any of us sail?


Ja, I can write it down.


I can go first? Who am I next to? Who's Beau next to?


700. TRAVIS 700. Here's 800 gold.


Nobody move.


Is there any sign of windows that are blacked out?


Testosterone poncho.


Well, the skies were turning; the wind was coming in; and I honestly have to mention my knee hurts a little bit on the left side, usually about an hour beforehand. It was a thing my sister did. It was 25 seasons ago, give or take. She's a piece of work. She's great. A piece of work.


And we have a prisoner.


What if he sends you out, and we kill you?


My Helm of Brilliance.


That's a strength saving throw or prone.


I feel like I should do earmuffs right now again.


How tall is the mountain?


Congrats to our t-shirt winners! [music]


So Matt? Hypothetically, if I rolled a critical failure trying to go Shining on the door, what would happen?


No worries.


Did you bring those?


We're here to mend any broken bridges, so to speak.


Okay, so I run back and I go, oh, here you are.


Build a fucking water park, let's go!


The fear I have with the book is of course if we keep it, we keep it out of the hands of everyone, save those who are finally strong enough to best us.


Keyleth would be proud.


Character choice!


I can make you invisible.


Let's divvy up the loot. I've worked it out, that's 19 platinum apiece, and two gold pieces apiece.


I was going to go take a seat next to Pike, at some point. I've got a letter for you.


I'll cast Eldritch Blast at it.


I'm keeping an eye open for anything familiar.


Hundreds.


I could just use my-- oh.


I pull out my gun.


Yeah, I'll try that.


Or you can use your action to heal.


I don't know if that was the easiest membership I've ever obtained, or the most difficult membership I've ever obtained. It's kind of hard to say.


They don't have Raven Queen cots or something?


How is everyone?


We should get out of here.


That's cool. Okay, I love you, and thank you. So I roll 4d8. Cool. Oh wait, wrong one.


Oh, saving throw? Well I rolled twice.


Connected to each other?


Whatever's available would be just fine.


I walk over and pick up my sword slowly.


We are sending everyone we know into one centralized location. Do we really feel like that's a good idea?


It's so far!


You know-- Hey man.


How does Thordak know you're alive?


(whispers) I'm not gonna tell you.


Okay. I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going to hide against the window so nobody can see me.


Oh no! Ugh!


Nope, Nott's immune to fear.


Trinket is a cat.


I rolled a 14 to attack the water elemental.


Is radiant flame the same?


Sorry, you're super covered-- literally saw no features until right now.


I mean, I'm assuming it takes like four points of damage immediately, my cat.


18, but armor after those faces, is set to necrotic damage.


The cube shrinks to half its size.


Does that get halved because of raging?


Other terrain or an animal?


Yeah, we are going to buy them. We are buying them!


Oh. I pull mine out as well.


Beadle and Grimm's, dndbeyond.com/promotions/platinum.


Not for you. No, not for you!


He monked up!


Do we, the four of us, all go up in the trees?


Can I try and move some of the rubble off of the bronze rod?


Run away.


What is your name?


I mean, it wasn't bad.


I dump all the beans out on the table. Are there any beans that look different from the rest?


Just as realistic as possible.


Yeah. As we go up topside, I say quietly to Nott: You know, I did not allow for Gallan to go inside the bubble, so it's all the same to him, let's go.


I'm called Burt Reynolds, and I take great offense at that.


A lot of times they do.


That's the biggest one. The main one.


I just turn Beau around like, (shouting) That was amazing! How did you do that with a throwing star?


Instant replay!


Oh my gosh. You guys are awesome.


We can't accept this, right? I mean, it's too much.


By the way, audience, Travis pointed out as we left, they might not know what we were talking about when we all said, "oh, we're going to jack off now." It means unplug our microphone cords.


That's gold.


If I try to pull on the sleeve, does it come up to my elbow or does it stretch out and fit?


Oh! That a fucker's, oh! Okay. Things can still go wrong.


He sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius.


I am sorry that we left in the way that we did. Would your mom ever think of leaving Nicodranas?


Go kill it?


It’s the one where you lie on your back, right?


He's even more of an idiot.


I'll back up a tidbit.


Yeah, I'll take a seat.


Anyway, I was really certain after that moment that we would be together forever and I never saw him again.


Are they carpeting up? How are you going up?


And we don't even really need to make tunnels, do we?


You fly and you heal better. You're pretty good.


Scanlan! (gasps)


Is there?


But he can carry ten. That's easier.


You know, the only reason we were out of the inn is because we were looking for you, Caleb. We didn't know where you went.


No, I'm-- yeah, I'm there-ish.


Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)


And talk to Pa'tice.


Well, this is definitely official political business. I will also say, could you direct us to the quarry? We are new in town.


Did that seem real enough?


You've got a big stick.


Is 28, so that obviously hits. And that is seven. And then the third dagger comes down. Is 29, and that also hits. So I've shanked his ass, that's an eight. (stabbing noises)


I'm getting drinks for everybody. I assume we've got the table at this point.


You mean two weeks ago or are we after--


We are planning to rebuild our home in Emon as well.


We're sealed here, and they are watching. We're with a couple of tieflings, a little person in a doll mask, and a dirty ginger. We've got people staring at us every second of the day. We need to dial it back a little bit.


Keyleth got her first kiss!


Okay, then I'm using now dagger of venom is 26.


Wait, you forgot to add stuff?


I step up to the table, and begin my scrying ritual, checking on Syngorn first.


Oh, definitely not at Whitestone.


It worked well.


No. (laughs)


Nothing but this cart. We are full of coin and yet have no products for trade. We hope to fix that south of the border.


That's what I say to all my women.


That's not too bad, could be worse.


He can't; he's burned.


What should we do? Should we wake everyone up?


It's a finger ring.


Yeah, I would have quieted down with the singing and just tried to go more lowkey. I don't know what's going on, so I'm still watching the boat.


Do I still have any more movement?


Yes, mainly they were whores who kicked me out early.


What happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else.


Trinket's on the sidelines, man.


I only stay enlarged for ten minutes.


Give me the bow, right now.


They threatened us.


A deal is a deal.


Any physical weaknesses, or things that he is vulnerable to that we should know?


Tary?


This is real bad. What is that? That's eight.


I really want brunch right now.


(laughs) Very murderous.


Wait, are we going already or do we have the night?


I thought it was just going to slam you into the ground!


Okay, that's a natural one.


Ahh, it's beautiful.


She's been here a very long time. Let's just knock her unconscious and let her be.


Can you do that to all of us?


It's still for another hour! Thank you, Magic: the Gathering - Puzzle Quest.


Should we clear out of here while you work on this bomb?


There's a little town not far from here called Alfield. It might actually have use for a doctor right about now.


Giving us a Walking Dead decision.


No, it's Vex.


I feel deeply capable, but I feel deeply capable.


Yeah, I remember we had this conversation before.


Wouldn't you hate to miss it by 15 minutes?


He hasn't attacked us.


Scanlan, Keyleth, if I had magic, I would freeze all the water, so go ahead and do that.


Bag of Holding.


Thank you, they've been-- your friends have spoken very highly of you in your absence.


A thousand feet was all you needed.


Things!


This is because of us, and you all know it is. Let's figure this out. Go, Pike. (laughter)


Holy moly! So that's this. 13 for the arrow and then 4d8 for the spell. (counting) 17!


(whispers) Really?!


(squeaking) Quick conversation?


Six! I'm going to stay on the ground.


We have to get these shields down.


I don't see-- I don't know what you're saying. Waft your smell in the direction that--


Almsnuffufin... Um, Eon? Something?


Remember when my kiss healed you from death? Just throwing that out there.


Where? Where do we drop them off at?


I can't use acrobatics?


We could try.


Have you ever eaten an orphan?


Hey, we got those Electric Beargaloo shirts! You guys, did you know we have a bunch of new items in our shop?


Is Lady Kima with us?


That's kind of rich for my blood.


Anybody in weird cloaks?


Get us out of the way, Tommie. 25 seconds to impact.


On the plus side, we're all very tired now.


(gunshot sounds)


You're a dipshit!


Plus three? So, 12.


I know, I'm looking at the scandalous one over there that's always trying to get little goodies for himself.


Does it do dances? I'm confused.


Okay. That is a 22.


Change the name!


That never happens.


No, he hasn't used it. (gasps)


Don’t they stand on the wall? Don’t they stand on places?


Tary Jumbo--


Oh shit! Well, then it's just Vex or Percy? Or wait, are those two, too?


I heard Mr. Clay. Let's go. I'll scramble out, going into the direction that I heard the sound and seeing all these folks over here.


I can hold him. Might piss him off.


Oh! And Vex loves you.


You may.


Actually, I'm going to use the good sword. It doesn't matter. That's awful, and that's pretty good. That's 11, that misses, and 19, that hits.


DTPB. (laughter)


We should lead it off the road.


Thank you for that smattering of applause. Golf claps, please. Golf claps.


I've had plenty of water.


17, what do I add?


So six, that's it?


Oh. I don't want to do that.


It might.


I cast Reduce, and now he is half his size.


Choose any player including yourself to discard his or her hand and draw a new card. Hector, burn your card.


I kind of like a challenge.


Without those, we'll see his feminine wrists. (laughter)


How much is it?


18 is probably--


Now 10d8 radiant damage. I may just roll these twice, okay, so the first one. Okay, ten plus seven, so 17, plus another seven is 24 radiant, and then (counting) 19 damage. Radiant damage.


Don't cheapen this!


I slide one coin away from the other nine, and then dragging my finger across those say, is there anything out of the ordinary these days?


He's only six feet tall?


These are dog people? Let's take the path with the trap.


How about equal assurance that you don't fuck us over?


Let me see what I packed.


Yeah, well, it's called Slow, not Stop. If it was a Stop spell, it would be called a Stop spell.


It towers over the entire --


And that's my action?


I take that back, that's a great idea.


Said Harvey Fierstein. (laughter)


Great. Oh, okay. Well, one was 31.


I love your hat!


Trinket kraken. Trinket kraken.


Why don't you take the next one?


Are they especially bowing to Scanlan the snake slayer?


Send those suggestions to @laurabaileyVO on twitter.com!


Pike, what happened?


Who Dis? Who dat?


It's the salt water. It'll be white around the edges and really sting.


Are they in the palace?


Wait, Grog. Can I check for any traps or is it like totally fine? Because I've been here before and it's not pleasant.


The chain is magic.


Yes you did, Percival.


Caleb, steady.


I would need to think about it. Regardless, I think now is not the time. Perhaps we go look for Osysa's mate.


Keyleth, did you roll 17 or 19 on your--


Light this candle!


With resistance?


He won! Let's go get your winnings, because I think that should cover the amount I just spent on getting you out of jail.


I was trying to skip exposition, I thought you guys could fill in the blanks.


I have my bonus. Can I move and then attack again?


And! Actually, I think that's about it. There's still like, the shirts. Some sizes are available but some of them are out of stock, and that's all being reprinted. So you guys, it'll be back in the store very soon. Go check out the store!


The enemy of my enemy...


Does it look like a big enough tunnel now that I can move the pipe?


To the Swamp!


Yeah, it's stuck up there, ja?


No, I wanted to do more than that. Let's say 200 yards.


I definitely think we should take the diplomacy route. The place is heavily guarded. There seem to be lots of Carvers.


Yeah. Instinct, buddy.


What's the smaller one?!


Oh my god, you guys, let's go all of these places.


He's eating that extra meat pie.


Then can I go three squares north to the edge and hold my attack until someone steps up?


Mm-hmm. Oh, sorry. Yep, took another one before. I don't know, kind of a habit.


I can understand that.


Might as well die one way or another.


See you on the other side.


Does anybody have a problem with that? It's just like, y'know, piece of shit: (killing noise), and he's gone.


But why did you decide the way that you're saying it?


Thank you. (singing) Something has changed within me.


All stuff.


What was it? Was there anything in there?


Do I get your thing of plus two because I'm standing next to you?


I am, yeah. We left, we packed up. Some thoughts I just have inside my head.


Can I read it?


We don't need it now, but we're going to be-- need to move--


How long have you felt this way? This is a bit--


I feel like an asshole.


Great. Great Weapon Master, dwarven thrower, and I say I want to know the answer to the lesson! (everyone laughs)


Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans)


So eyeball, hand, you showed her yours.


Still.


By the way? I think Algar's unconscious. He might be dead.


She said begrudgingly.


I'm also going to go ahead and be like, hey guys. I made breakfast! And make a Heroes' Feast.


The airship was only going to take us to Emon, anyway.


We're going to do-- Those pictures already exist, they shared them with the chatroom. Yeah, so we're going to do this. We're going to do a whole other set of these when we get to the next 50.


Give him a goodberry.


Yeah, that's cool. Who's the publisher? Is that first print? First edition?


Let's walk the half-mile. It's a half-mile!


Yeah, okay. So I reach in and take out the big bronze pot.


Step up.


We got Briarwoods to kill.


Stop it! Don't be helpful!


13 points. And then I say  come on, Tary!


Oh, Grog. By the way.


He's doing what he wants to do.


Ja. Come on, roll big. Nope. Athletics? Nein!


No, 'cause we can do it underwater, can't we?


It's not here yet.


Got hundreds, y'all!


Is there a door knob or anything that looks like a seal?


Okay, I’m going to run past her room towards the west, and do I have a view right there?


It's all an act, dear.


(laughs) It's a 20.


Voodoo doll.


You want to be a monkey? Yeah. What kind of monkey?


I think it was a little bit of combination. A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. I think he called you Vex'ahlia.


But, I do have a nice little wineskin that I keep reserved, of my family's wine, if you want to taste.


No, he can do it again to all of us.


I'm going to step one step forward with it, no further than Grog stepped that first time.


They are goblins!


Oh man. What does he want-a!


Yes, I would like to shift out of my mouse form.


You've no idea what they want?


In the haversack!


And then you saw him here for the first time in quite a while, yes?


I respect her so much. (sighs)


Good job, Tiberius.


I don't know if I've killed an elf in quite a while, so I'm going to aim my axe at the throat of the elf that's dancing.


I was mocking him, yes.


Does it look like traps? You want to perceive them?


All right, fine. He's a human thing again.


44 for the first and for the second is one. That's it. Is one plus the Hunter's Mark again, right?


You're going to try to undo the trap?


Maybe we could create a distraction and bring them away from the tunnel's entrance and we can just sneak around them. No?


Let me do my fucking thing, man. Let me do my fucking thing.


It makes sense for anyone who had gone into their basement and seen the cat go (humming).


I would be looking for Vorugal too, though.


It's different.


Apparently. I just don't understand why you were still enigmatic after you already told us in front of Pelor. It's kind of a slap in the face.


(sighs) Okay. Lesser Restoration, would that do anything in this situation?


I don't need to be subtle, I'm just standing around, you guys are arguing, he's making a fool of you, I'm just changing my cloak. I have 17 cloaks.


We have to save some for those guards.


I could do a bonus action to heal somebody. Who's down really bad, can I see Pike?


I know I won't succeed, so I won't. I just want to get a look.


(quietly) Don't encourage it.


It is. It is going to be useful.


That's a religion check, not history check?


You're checking out the shack?


I can move as the planetar?


Yeah, but I'm not asking. I'm just wondering.


Is that what's in your belly?


Tieflings are like horned, pseudo-demonic--


It's like Medieval Times.


I'll tell you later. I have to run an errand. We have to get to this fucking meeting, yeah?


I am a betting man, and this is a bad bet.


On a scale from one to ten, I would call him striking.


I keep going.


All right. No, that's a good use of a legendary action.


I start pushing the bed up against the door.


Any books, 13?


I thought you were trying to say "by people."


Hey, nice job.


I'm super special. It's about to get extra in here. So if I do a blood curse and I take damage, does that mean that my werewolf state gets agitated? If it's self-inflicted?


Your dead things don't stealth, I would assume?


That was definitely a six. That was a six!


Oh no! Not my sweet boy!


What kind, like a buddy?


Can I just clock the tabaxi and see where that satchel with our blood in it is? Did she happen to put it down while she was over?


But it was a good show, wasn't it?


A big animal.


And I still have Control Water going.


We honestly all do.


Lot of help you were!


Oh jeez, okay. Well, I've still got two 3rd-level spells.


I say to Keyleth, get this shit off me. I don't want it to see me. Please. And then I will walk to the other side of Percy. We don't see the thing, right?


If we hit you really hard, would you still be standing up right now?


Do you believe in the gods? Do you believe that Vax actually serves Death?


You said silver and we're being fair!


Deadless?


Do we have a safety word?


Yeah. See? No big deal.


Seems terrible.


Pike, now's a good time to talk about us, don't you think? No, I'll just put my hand on the gem.


They don't care, they're swinging low and leaving it behind.


Oh, he's fucking wasted.


This is something worse than umberhulks, I assume.


You're going to bird in? They're going to see you fly in.


Damn it. Ooh!


That's the most insane roll I've ever seen.


Maybe not just yet.


This is everything I wanted. Yeah, let's go to the rooms.


230,000 gold. If we're hearing correctly.


No, no, no. He's saying we send a cipher and a translated page with the entire book.


That happens, yes.


She's in human form, by the way. (laughs) It's just how she talks.


Let's meet in a room at the casino.


I have a hard time thinking that we're gonna get anything out of you in that mask.


I mean, we got a little under 24 hours. Fuck it, let's look.


In my personal holdings-- I don't really remember putting this there-- but apparently I have five sticks of incense that I have no intention of using.


Damn, could you be more ominous, Orly? Were you trying? I think he was trying.


But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are The Champions?


Remember to be super direct with his name.


That's a good fortune.


Oh, no! Okay, that's-- oh, wow.


One necrotic. 12 points, with one necrotic. Shot number one. Next shot, same thing. Standard shot. That ran, but 22? Oh, sorry. It's not 22. I'm so tired. 17. That misses.


16 hits.


I don't know. I can try something! I can do a similar thing, have them see something behind them, but you can do the same thing. Yours are already cast, right?


Ten? He made his save.


One does, one does not.


They're two big dogs, right?


I take some cloth from the Bag of Holding, from one of those old fancy cloaks that we have.


I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go and turn into a bird.


We were.


Do I see any other--


Then let's just fucking go home.


As before, we love you guys!


And you've met us before? No?


One, two, three, four. You may keep that one. Thank you.


A lot of killing, disintegrating.


1,500?


You didn't fight them at all?


Fuck it, Grog, let's go downstairs.


Yeah, so check it out.


That is hard core.


The witch?


It goes pew pew!


Matt, how much do we know about black powder?


You said 57 damage?


For my bonus-- oh wait, that's a 4th-level spell. Should I use it or not?


(whispering) Fuck.


Super duper short.


He's in the buck!


A flatterdesplat.


I'm frenzy raging.


Yes. Very far-off, mountainous, dark. Very dark.


Are you leaving from here to there?


Just a wretched fellow. They've made off with quite a bit of our product, and we have some evidence against them. We tried to take it to the Lawmaster, of course, we didn't want to trouble you, but--


Oh, that's unfortunate.


They're in season right now.


Apparently, he's fine.


Yeah, I had a problem with one of my ears. It's like two years in. No one has diagnosed it correctly. In the beginning, it was wildly disorienting. I didn't know what was going on. The symptoms were way more extreme than what I'm going through now, so it's not gone, but it's managed, and I've found that running helps a lot, which is why I run like a madman now. And... the most important thing in my life is my wife and my two children. The second most important thing in my life are the people on this couch and this bench. It's kind of eclipsed my job, for me, in the last couple of years. Looking forward to these nights was huge for me, both when I was in the thick of it and still. And I look at everyone here as a second family.


They all look similar.


(yelling) Close the gates!


And I do trust Allura.


Plus anything else? Wait, plus two damage to all-- oh, but that's already--


Does he have any pouches on him, or anything in his hands?


Seven, eight--


Where? What the--


While we're going, I need to sit next to Kiri, and I'm going to pull out my sketchbook, and I'm going to ask her to write down everything she can think of about her mom and dad, and draw a little picture of them, because I'm going to try to do Sending for her mom and dad.


But what if there's gold down there to find?


I'm not even trying to hide it this time.


The door to get back inside is located where?


I crouch down on the roof above Caleb, and I go (bird coo).


Touching the hat.


I'm going to stay right there.


Maybe I messed up. Like I said, I'm not very good in the outside world, and I thought that I found it here, but-- It's fine.


Yeah, we're just waiting on you to make the touch.


I'll go with Nila, then.


I assume it is, yeah. Yeah. Where did it go? Where did it go? This is my first time casting it.


Oh, you can!


You guys are doing a great job with that, really.


Which ones?


In our defense--


Do I look buff?


Everyone who's a cloud, we're floating back to Emon. Let's go.


Of the what?


He's not listening to this right now.


I looked for, like, magical items along the way. I didn't find them. So I went to Vasselheim, which is where the Slayer's Take is. And I think before I left, I wanted to get some personal things, like, done to my body. So I had the bear tattoo that I filleted of off Kevdak, and I had it tanned, and then I got a copy of that tattoo on my back.


At advantage minus five on both the rolls I rolled a nine, and a one. So hey.


That is the greatest kite ever.


Three of them with Bane. It's a charisma saving throw.


I just go  Oh, fuck! Turn around and walk back in.


No! Are they in place?


Terry.


She kept referencing a book.


A shorter way of saying the same thing.


Okay. One. Two. Three. Easy. Thank you very much.


I sharpen it. It's so sharp. I sharpen it every night.


Should we send Vax ahead?


Hitman!


Just out of curiosity, do my wings 'shloop' back in?


Look, I've got these huge clumsy-fuck hands. Is there anything you could give me, maybe magical, that would just keep me from being embarrassed in front of my friends? It smells so bad and then they all come and the door opens and it's just awful!


Hey, hold on, hold on.


Oh, screw it. You know what? There's nothing like a spiritual weapon to tear into a-- [cheering]


Very fit.


From the citizenry.


I'm not saying they're nice. I'm saying that maybe we need some new guidance.


Just once a day. Then second does not get sneak attack? Even though it's at disadvantage.


Why don't you tradesies with me, then?


To hit. To kiss.


Thank you. I want anything but chicken.


I think I'm perfectly content with it being someone else's problem.


Be that as it may we riled up a city of --


Honestly, I've never taken this road before. This is further east than I've ever come.


(grumbles) All right. Well, look the other way. Find some things that are of value.


Moses shit.


Somatic and material. All I did was just do this with my thumb and I put a little bit of rouge on my cheek.


Not for long.


I just start--


Oh shit. No, it's not. It's a 23. I'm strong as fuck.


No, the other one besides that.


No, it's going to pay off.


Might be fun.


Do it then. Subtly.


20d6!


Okay, all right. I'm going to amplify it. So that means I take 14.


No. We've got to find a way to get them talking again.


I don't know. 500 feet.


How's that gun barrel of yours?


(stuttering)


I jog on down.


I don't think your cousins are fish people.


Just literally right there at the table.


Like, didn't come back ever?


We ran into a tribe on the way here, you wouldn't happen to know an older woman named Jumnda would you?


It's fine. I'll cast Fly on Doty.


We got to cut that dead weight, man.


Disadvantage on your checks.


So an hour before that, I'm starting to enchant the staff.


All right, if we rest, I can learn Water Breathing.


Oh, I know, I was trying to hide, though. Like, back away from you as you were doing that.


Let's feed her to Trinket and go on.


You got caught with your hand in the cookie jar.


She takes the paper from Yasha and darts off down the street.


Ah! I take off running again.


Two ones in a row.


Do I look like I have-- no!


First chance for violence is all yours. You're the first one in.


There's nothing down there, right?


This is maybe awkward, but you and we share something in common. Our past is awkward. I get the sense that yours is not as much. Your people, are they a mix of many kinds?


Well it hurts you.


I can help them... in the morning. (laughter)


Does Molly do birthday parties for kids?


3 weeks.


I'm going to be a guard. I'm going to be the guy we just snuffed.


With the gnomes or the tree stride? Or Teleport Via Plants?


Let's leave it. Tend to the sick and leave the well alone.


Which?


Nine, 14, 22, 32. Plus eight is 40.


There's a lot of heads in the way. Just aim true.


Well, off the bat, I don't know where that is in D&D Beyond yet. But if I open up my binder I bet I have a paper version that I can verify with. I speak Sylvan, Common, and Celestial and I also can Comprehend Languages as a ritual spell but I think that takes some time.


Can I get up at this point or no?


We've got to think about it.


Some beers. I want some Chicago-style pizza.


I'll be in front of you, just so we have a cleric on either end.


Yes, and this sort of thing takes a lot of work from very specialized people.


Yeah, the Riflemen of Whitestone. (whispers) Musketeers. (laughter)


Is he Kaiju-sized?


Shove that dingleberry in there.


I think that everyone in this town is dangerous, so eyes wide open.


Come on! (singing) Get it, girl. Get it, get it, girl.


I'll take the 17. I know, it was almost a 20.


So, maybe you should do that--


Blame me, blame me.


Isn't that the only way to just treat all things? I guess, I don't know. I don't know.


Someone wants to hear Gilmore's voice.


Fireball!


His home doesn't really exist anymore.


We're going to need everybody. It's worse than we could have imagined.


At disadvantage!


Should a few of us kind of like flank around and--


But this thing was worth blowing up a tower for.


Does the DM get a playlist?


Unlimited.


Nope, just eggs.


Okay. Wait, I've got to see how this works. I just throw it in the air and it turns into a cone.


50. No, it's not 50. I think the difficulty, I can't find it, but I think it's 18.


Oh, that's true. That's true.


(muffled) Okay!


No, I have the shoes on my feet--


He's the one that's going to give us access to the rest of the city.


I love their banter.


We only have like 60 pounds of scales from previously, left over. (thumps)


How did you guys find us?


You saved my life.


(baby talk voice) Oh, who's DPB? Who's DPB?


Stay frosty.


He's making this up as he goes.


You know how there's always a time where the narrator stops, lets your imagination run wild with what happens?


We need to find Kashaw. Before the meeting, yes?


Oh no, I got it! God!


I was carrying you all along.


Thanks, friend, that's great.


Perception check. Nine.


She's a little girl.


Is there a front and back to this thing, or is it just a whirling dervish?


Lemures are infernal Pokemon, is basically what you're getting to.


What you're hearing is the happiness of a performer.


They are very pretty, yes. Where did you find them?


No, it's not good.


You know, I want some more.


Yeah, we sit. It's polite.


Leonard Hyphen? Hyphen what?


I'm going to run forward and touch him and cast Inflict Wounds.


Well, yeah, we could get the skull back because I was just going through my notes, my old diary, of everything that we've been through--


Why do you keep saying she's 'related to' you? Why don't you just call her exactly what she is? Which is your daughter.


I suppose we could ask the same of your Herd, Leader Zanror.


I got what we needed. I got myself a bean.


I'm going to creep up 20 feet in front of everybody else.


No, it's terrible. Would you like that?


Okay. Are you tough? Because you don't look it.


Oh, okay. I'm going to, (groans). God there's so few people to kill now. (all laugh)


It's fake. It's just a hologram.


That was the worst Schwarzenegger action line ever. (Terminator voice) Hope they have flood insurance, ja.


I'm going to scoot against the wall towards myself as far as a reasonable amount of movement will take me because I don't like clumping. I'm going to take aim at the asshole in the sky, and let's do a couple of things. I'm going to take Bad News out, and just to keep everything reasonable, I'm going to burn a point for dead-eye, and I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot on him.


Da.


We were talking about how much you wanted a monologue. I really feel like this is the moment.


Oh, I'm good.


I can't do it again.


Just kicking it, just chilling.


The priest's dead. Is there anyone else, or should we head back?


He wanted to be a god, but he wasn't a god.


Is he looking rough?


Her mind becomes feverish, and she has disadvantage on intelligence checks and intelligence saving throws, and she becomes confused.


I'm going to put my hand up and say, quietly, to Nott, the Moneypot is not for them. It's not for them, it's for farmers. Okay?


Did you just put a hooker on layaway?


Band of Shrouds. While attuned, all creatures and their belongings within 60 feet of the bearer are immune to most divine magics that would locate or reveal the whereabouts of the creature.


Where are they?! Let me at them! I'll save you all!


That's good. That's another six for Hunter's Mark. Plus another 11.


Won't the sound attract all of the things? I feel like the sound will attract all of the merrow people.


He helped write several seasons of The Voice, which was all about a capella, so Samis sort of a ringer for the bard class.


Too long.


I know. Sorry. I know, I thought about that. Come on, baby, no whammies. Do I double the dice?


Yeah. Actually, can I do that? Like it's a camera drone?


Fucking ziggurat!


Can we get some food?


Lot of Fonzies. Smells terrible.


They're dead. Turn around. Let's go back. They're dead.


He's not my son!


Okay, okay! Okay. Who the fuck are you, though? Seriously?


Really? I don't think I've ever seen you angry.


And Trinket!


26 hits.


No, I'm awesome.


No. Let's wait in real time. 11 minutes.


It's a waste of 500.


Whew! Grog, you okay?


Yes, girl, yes!


Yeah, but then it wouldn't be me. It'd be something else that's not me that I can control?


Can I also go like, (bash) Stop hitting yourself! (all laugh)


She's a ripped halfling.


Yeah, it comes with a story.


--a pirate.


Poor Nightcrawler.


With a swimming speed of 40 in gold.


The two of you, inside the mansion. Now.


Shifty eyes.


Beyond anything interesting. Everything is too interesting.


We don't need any, darling. We're fine.


I think it's bloodroot.


4d8. I'm taking yours, and I hope that's okay. Ten, 13, 18, 21. Plus something?


Hold up.


Oh, I rolled lower!


Now close out of that.


What's wrong? Did you guys get into a fight?


The world is right again!


How much further do we have to go up?!


I figured we just sat under the Sun Tree.


31 points of psychic damage.


I will put in 100 gold.


Ooh yeah! Natural 18. 21.


Scanlan is not on fire anymore.


Funny how that works. No, I'm good where I am.


16 hits. This time I do 12 points of damage.


Ha! Ha! Am I near Keyleth?


Like whitestone dust?


There, see?


It is very dark in here, what kind of bird is that you have?


Sorry, everybody does it. Our mother did it, I do it sometimes.


How are we going to get enough gold to pay all of these people?


I see what you're doing and I like it. I like a good ghost story. Maybe--


Let's do-- Let's do green.


Oh, bugger.


Yeah, just to cover it up a little.


I cast Grasping Vine to grab onto her.


All right, I will cast Sanctuary on young Keyleth.


How do we get armies there?


Well, you've been doing new spells and things. It's pretty--


Come on, man!


Okay. 11.


We have all the pieces buried underneath every civilian.


I know. 16 points of damage on the first one.


You're looking delighted and delightful.


Your accent is thick.


I'm so glad you're back. Don't cry.


Yeah, I miss having a proper tent, and the wagons were nice. I miss that.


Who brought a fucking parrot? Damn it, Jester.


Roll a d20?


Vex. We are so rich.


Give him the chair!


I'm going to need somebody to teach me this trick.


Is there any way I can help her? Like being also proficient in forging in this background and stuff?


I know that you are angry, and I am just-- I'm sorry.


This is an ongoing dream that you have been having?


Huh. That's weird.


I said 5,000 subs, not my dignity and everything. I will put on the damn outfit at 5,000. That's all I have to offer. I'm already still working on a damn music video, so all I have left to offer is my dignity and every ounce of pride I have in anything.


Or watch, see what they're doing.


Trinket the bear, Trinket the bear.


Is she just unconscious?


No, he has disadvantage on attacks until the end of his next turn.


We have to stop it with magic, or nets.


Except for the ones who come on our show.


Well, in the vision the three land masses are in a triangle.


Medallion of five o'clock shadow.


He's a real bear. He's a real bear.


To buy a fine pig.


--Friend.


Fists of fury, Mrs. Henderson!


Is this how D&D works?


Oh my gosh, what if we could intercept it? Then we could have all of the poison, and the nips.


On three?


Well, it's just open, it's just an open book.


We're really doing it.


I creep over to one of the doors in the room and see if I can hear anything on the other side.


Okay, she said dreams. She had a dream.


Yes, we have.


Her crew?


She's much better at this than you.


And he doesn't seem to be distracted or give two shits about him.


Kaitiaki. (all laugh)


I cannot wait for you both to be angry with me later.


Does it look like acid? Does it look like what we're used to with acid?


Ruin?


Can you yank his shit down?


We kill this one, it'll set off a chain reaction that we might not be able to recover from if we're not fully prepared.


Sorry. My aim was off.


Thank you so much for your information-- I take a gold coin and I'm just like, is this enough? Yes, that's good. Thank you. So we-- we'll be going. Yeah?


What made you leave in the first place? (background music)


Anyway, I have this thing, and I could've used it then to really hit you but I'm not going to. I'm going to save it for something really powerful. Are you in the room, Yasha?


Two silver. Well, you know, I just wanted to play the game. I'm not trying to make any money. Did you want to do anything here?


We're only going an hour down, tops.


56.


Yeah, swimming down.


And a greater healing potion! Five healing potions really.


I'll try to catch up, too.


You putting this on me?


Can we carve in the lair "Thordak was here" or something?


I don't know what it means, but it sounds good.


Maybe you can tell him there's a big fight coming. Call out to him! Get his attention.


Tell them to go away and go somewhere else, and have more land.


So, cast it at a higher level.


Within a few days we'll forget he ever existed.


Wait! Maybe if one of our horses is a pack horse, you could be on top of the horse wrapped in a blanket or something. You're part of the gear that the horse is carrying.


Oh, god damn it!


You'd better.


Sir, I couldn't help but hear that this is about a mile outside of the city. Is that correct?


Can I do that on the other one, opposite her?


Sorry, I didn't realize it was--


Yeah. Of course, really anything.


I've got a list, I've got a fiends book.


Oh god, it's so scary! It's a leopard with snake heads!


We need one of those leashes for him.


(whispering) This is Yasha.


So I say we head north first. Find the main road.


I don't know why everyone's so excited about the notion of pissing off the dragons to the point at which they all come here, but it is a way to go.


Plus, we need to rest.


That's awesome! Who cares? Light it up!


Would you call it infectious?


Yeah, I've been told I'm very impotent. (laughter)


You could fucking kill me!


You think.


It's my spell? What is it?


No, in the bones?


(singing) It's murder time in the campaign.


But we still have weeks left, don't we?


Yeah, we forgot to qualify that.


It's a patch potion.


Bring it. I have no fear.


She was going to send it to The Pillow Trove.


Yeah, I think that's--


That's the first. The second is a 20 to hit. And the third is a 27 to hit.


I'm pretty fried. I fought something, though. It was lightning that came down and then turned into a creature.


Oh. Well, because you could be.


Well, there was no marking for a tower.


A Mass Healing Word.


Have any of us eaten?


Yeah, we level up for that.


Wait! Has anyone gone and come back?


Oh. We have to go to your actual bedroom?


I still like the idea of perhaps the two of you working together. You could talk to Scanlan about it and see if he'd be all right-- (laughter)


Show us.


Luck of the day. Yes!


Is Doty, Dottie, his robot around?


How much of the bounty?


It's not an ambush if they can see where we are.


All of us? Noisy out here.


We would like to discuss.


Yeah. And your brain is already so little.


Tomorrow my blue friend is going to, if we need to, cast a spell on you and make you tell us everything we want to know. Why waste that time?


This is our best chance, because there are no Iron Shepherds here.


No, he wants to be right there.


I undo the lock so he can talk.


I want to go there, and I want to kind of sit down and meditate for a second. And I want to cast Speak With Plants and have a little chat with the Sun Tree.


The effect of that hasn't taken place yet, correct?


I know. I know. But for now, let's just catch up. What have you guys been up to for the last year?


That I trust. I trust that more. Fine. Good.


(mumbling) This protective amulet of the shield ... adding plus five to your AC against that attack.


Everything will be fine!


Okay, that's a ten, that's a ten, this is a ten. Balls. Ten, 12, 13. 13.


Right along the ledge.


Yeah! You leave after us Caleb, okay?


I was about to say, why--


Maybe some weapons or some potions that might help should we find ourselves--


Augustus Gloop!


Eh, 14.


Yes. Well, I mean, I don't know how correct these are--


And that is 30, no, 28?


What device?


Sky's clear.


Because things happened so fast for him!


I think that means you owe me three gold, Percy.


Ooh, we were just there!


Haggle with the pope.


You know salt water is bad for the armor, right?


We should talk to him.


No. I should to talk to more dwarves before I try to... yeah.


So he can take necrotic damage.


This the second time Grog's almost fallen to his death.


Yeah, do it!


Well, I will remember this. I have a perfect memory, I will remember this exactly.


This is pretty cool.


No, no assistance needed.


This is going to be so sad.


I'm going to quietly sneak out the back of the tent again and sneak into the--


I think we need to bring it. I think we're going to need a trophy.


Should we find Kima next, or should we spend the day here?


That's why he would be a rogue/barbarian, I think!


Like a mount sort of situation?


(laughs) I did something smart! (all laugh)


I mean, technically I can also turn into something flying, I could back you guys up, if someone else wants to take the carpet.


Oh, the actual, physical--


You definitely want to go follow him. I actually tweeted a picture from your Instagram account, so for those of you who are following me, there's a direct link to his Instagram account. Or just search this on Facebook or Instagram.


I'll run to the door that's closest to us.


Wow, this is the fucking craziest game ever. It's midnight.


Leave that box, that case, that box, be careful.


He’s a skinchanger.


Well, you weren't a proper adventurer until you were. Got to start somewhere.


On the pit fiend?


Eugh.


Is this your nymph?


I said it was the one against Percy, even though the other one is Hunter's Marked.


That would be a lot of photoshop, man.


Grabbing the skull and going--


This is like those Tatasciore spells. Like (mimics cutting out).


You're going to be stopping the cart? With that thing?


Well, that would be a nine.


I will walk behind Beauregard.


He had a Mick Jagger lifestyle.


Don't miss the beginning of the 50th episode.


Some pastries, if you have them.


Yeeeah!


Where'd it go, where'd it go, it was right-- Can I--


Engaged!


I don't know, so why don't you just minus six? 19, so we'll call it 13. Some people might have been catcalling me while I was trying to do math.


Looks like it's an eyeball.


Well, I've seen it several times coming through before. It's called the Tide Peak, but there are no doors.


I just got to something. Apparently I owe the IRS some money, and I have to go to Target to buy a gift card to send it to them.


My first game was with you, but then I've done other games since and I came back for this one.


Maybe we should ask Irena if it happens often when these things go on.


We'll go back to your temple. Will you help these people-- will you help these friends?


I've got goose pimples. Was that good for you guys or what?


He's just returning the bodies to their natural state.


Ow. Are we still moving?


(laughs) No paws! No paws!


Guard, escort the commoner out of the room.


They can fly. They can fly. Oh my goodness gracious. This is so cool. What is this? What is that?


I want that skull. I want it now.


Yeah! We're fine. We're great. Just doing dandy. Yep.


No! Why?!


It's the sword! It's the fucking sword!


Right. I'll--


Oh, we decided to get a statue for the garden.


Into somebody's laundry bag?


Well, that's what we've been doing this entire time.


Can you breathe? Can you breathe underwater?


I'm a little bit behind them. 28.


Wait, you're jumping in on this?


But the vibe I get, I'm not going to call it good. This is it. This is what you and I have been doing our homework for.


Whose baby?


Your mathematical skills have been quite impressive.


She sent us after Kima. Kima thinks that she's in the middle of a fight, the moment she comes out she'll be all hot and bothered--


You're tiny. You're dexy.


Until we find--


(laughs) Oh my god, what if they start fucking? (all laugh)


I think a cave entrance right here to somewhere where you can hide after you do the summoning and dive in and get about 25 to 30 feet away.


Tell me-- how much time?


(whispering) It's a graveyard.


Ten on the first one.


No, I was on Group Hug last week with somebody else's dice, and it was comedy.


This way, quickly, please!


The one in the bottom of the sea is called Whisper, right?


I can hear you. It is definitely acid.


Beautiful things should go to Pike, I think.


Grog just invented amusement park rides.


And I purr.


Oh, here. I pull out some herbs that I brought from my garden. Some glisfoil and other things.


Oh, just jumping right in?


Yeah. As we look around, do we see any markets? Actually, the shopping district would be a wonderful place to look for--


Wastehunter!


You get your own horse.


CritRoleStats is going-- (clicking).


Do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern? Or are we totally fucking turned around?


But you want the wish?


You know, I think it's right around that direction. Follow the gasping. It feels like it's really close to the gasping.


Taking them all.


Let's do it. 12.


Yeah, we've done nothing wrong. We're not sweating it. I'm not sweating--


Truly, put that away.


Well, I think it's because I'm--


I am not telling you that I found that at all.


I'm still picturing you in the stripy sailor outfit.


Okay. I'm next to Shale as well, right? We're all in the shit together?


I'm gonna fight back a little.


There's no tentacle in the range?


Keyleth's got angry tears of frustration in the back as she's trying to control the water. Runny eyeliner, like it's 2001.


I like it. Can I dig in his pockets?


Vax, you have your daggers back, right?


Yeah, you can do evocation with this one--


Your potion of haste.


By the way, when everyone asks me tomorrow on social media why I did it, same answer.


Cost of the contract?


Do you want the dodeca?


I'm going to attempt to take the piece of rope, place it against the wall, and take an ice shot slightly above the rope and freeze it to the wall.


He already did it.


No, you think so, or you don't?


That's my action, my bonus action, and my movement.


That's my spiritual weapon.


I feel like we should let Grog go.


Ah, wait wait wait wait wait - let’s figure out what’s going on!


I once teleported into the belly of a dragon with another jackass and that went tits up fast.


I am booking double speed to that door, 'cause I am useless--


Individuals?


We're 20 away from another TableTop giveaway, which we'll probably hit tomorrow.


I would like to pull Kerr aside and say, you know these people here, they're a bit lost, and they need a leader.


Don't kill people!


Here's what they forget  Jess and Steph are the ones doing it. If anyone's watched Jess and Steph's craft show, it will most likely end up being just a shaved face. If you think Jess and Steph can pull off Starburns, you're lying to yourself, and it will just end up being a clean shave.


This is where it gets complicated, I've got a plus one mod to charisma.


No, I'm going to move. I'm going to move around, over to here.


All right. 14.


Who by the way-- He's back in my necklace by the way. I don't want Trinket walking around here.


It's a lot of money.


Are you right-handed or left-handed?


Okay, so reckless. Let me see something here. Sorry. Where's the hex? Divine Fury? Can I do that as well?


Well, here. I'll just use this side, right?


I have resistance against poison because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind.


We're doing this?


I can do it one more time, but only to an animal, not an elemental.


Who's they?


-- if there's more than one of them these, though, he's gone boodle-oodle-ooo to his friends right now, I mean--


Such an asshole!


Get ready to run, people.


Well, he said he only wanted to be gone a week, though, right?


I mean, if you're only training, they send you to the frontline and it's questionable.


What do I do for a critical, then?


Wait, what's her name?


Oh my god, that's 11 to hit.


Why does my mouth keep producing saliva?


Just penciling and then penciling-- I've got a notion for a watch tower that's super super simple. Platform for two people, tops, with a rope that connects to a bell so when you start heading down it, it goes (high voice) Fuck!


Trust our luck. Our luck is going. I'm walking into this.


I'm going to start exploring the upstairs.


Howarth. Howarth.


Oh shoot, that's true. The next episode is Critmas, as well, isn't it?


Well, you got my scroll.


Aw! Can I call him Lumpy?


Other pets?


I don't think that's true, but we could do a token.


Oh, with negative d4.


Shut the fuck up.


That was a good plan?


Man, I hate level three.


I still have my bonus. I'll just punch him in the face.


Front and center!


It's a flint metal.


Fuck. There's no pattern.


Holy shit, Taliesin!


Ah! The golden snitch.


Oh, but you know what? I have really good dexterity.


All right. So what's next?


(whispers) Do you think Grog and I could shoot a gun?


We don't know where he is exactly-- (stammering) We've been speaking to the gods.


Stabbing duergars, stabbing duergars.


You got me an audition for Resident Evil.


We wouldn't do much damage to it there, in fact, it's probably laid several traps against us already.


Hey, I have an idea.


I turn to Clarota, I'm like, "Ooh, that's our friend, Pike. She's a good ally. Hello, Pike!"


The ol' reach-around.


Don't touch them.


Okay, is he still alive? I don't suppose I have advantage to hit anything that's pinned to the ceiling.


Congratulations, Sam.


Do you need an insight check to know that that was shady as fuck?


Is there any advantage from flanking anything?


Oh shit, we're all tied together!


There's a door behind there.


I like the tents and donkeys outside. Amazing.


Oh, bells in my face. (laughter)


Not great?


I'd say you have a pretty impressive sword, too.


I'm a writer and a reader. What are your hobbies?


He's real.


Better be safe.


He Van Damme'd it!


Yes, we do. All the lodestones.


As you can see, we're half-elves.


Let me go back to him. (deep sigh) Shenn.


We are idiots.


I see everything. Yes! Minus... 16.


I thought Ogden was as old as life itself!


At this point, though, it's chaos.


Is it fast to mist to the Fire Ashari?


Talk before that happens.


That one isn't as good, that's only four. Sorry. You pulled out all three of them at once, you know.


This is really pretty.


I feel like we should take 15 to 20.


All right, at the very least we can fake something for now. That's fair. What's my total right now?


Vax? Does it look like anyone has noticed the noise coming from this tunnel?


All right. But kill them, and then make a loud noise. Because as soon as we start shit rumbling, everybody gets paranoid and upset.


Check the lollipop, it's so inviting!


Nice improv!


You're the best!


We were told to set it up here, if I recall.


It's okay. It's just wood.


Life needs things to live?


Or maybe on the outside so she doesn't realize it's not made of lead?


It is kind of fucked that there's no music right now, and she's just--


I turn to Mollymauk and go, man, I thought it was kind of lame at first, but this is awesome!


Just one kiss? One little lick?


Not living things.


Can you look like an angel?


Found a Twiggy!


All right. I leave.


Oh, yeah? But you're still good.


For creamer! Did you say creamer?


You're not going to come with us again?


Yeah, it's so nice.


Just all of it.


Maybe, yeah. I'll try and get away, I guess. I've got a friend there, a legionnaire. He rescued me. He's a dwarf called Grim. I'm sure he'd help me find a secure place for the artifact. I don't know. Yeah. I guess I'll try and find somewhere to hide them and keep on trying to stop these guys.


And how does that happen in the first place?


Okay, Can I see? No. I'm gonna climb up.


But then this sword belongs to the guy who came to save Siff? The bounty hunter?


May I try it?


Boy, not that any of us can complain, but that guy likes to lay it on thick.


250 gold, if you'd be so kind.


Believe!


Yeah, thanks. I want to use one action to grab Scanlan by his purple shirt and rip him and pull him away.


I like it all, so I'm a fan.


Where do they go to do that? At the Geek and Sundry website?


Thanks, friend.


No. That is incorrect.


How loud will this be, do you think?


I just scream. I scream, and I start shooting arrows at Orthax.


It fought on its own.


He's not a person.


Why is he acting like he's starving?


Then I think snake is probably better to wiggle out, that's the thing.


It's a big ol' feast, I know, I know. It's a lot of food for you.


We should definitely do the research.


I'm hasted. I'm gonna try to go stealth again from where I am. So I'm stealth, 17-- 30. Okay. I'm going to scuttle along the floor and leap on the back of the basilisk and try to stab it in the eye while looking at the ceiling.


Well thank you for sharing that honest story with me. It means a lot.


Another alarm!


I'm taking my action surge.


Yes. Either, both.


Not that I can see.


Oh thank god--


Sort of like a golf club cover?


Okay. Yikes. Eight.


The rest of the days I'm going to parade around the deck in her clothing. Different outfits.


(laughing) 24.


I would not remember that shit.


We don't know where the prison is.


We care for these people, ja?


No? We should leave town?


All right, I'm going to lightning arrow? Is that going to do anything to fire? I'm going to lightning arrow the one that I've Hunter's Marked.


There's a couple more announcements. This one.


It's nighttime!


Can you let me in?


You have a trost here; that's what you do.


What did she say to you? Did she speak to you at all?


Okay, thank you. (louder) Thank you, horse, for riding us this far!


Oi, Grandma! Any yo-yos in there?


Before we go--


Wait! Do you want to do his foot first?


I had no idea. I jumped out when that happened.


You want some privacy?


This guy needs some calcium.


Okay, she's going to step out of the door, and she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon.


So dark. SO DARK!


Like once a week.


We'll be back in an hour.


Don't forget to tell them about Gilmore's Glorious Goods first. (laughter)


We're having a fight! Oh, oh sorry.


Sure glad we chose a spider!


I'll do that from outside.


Hey, twins? How do our flanks look if we move forward? Is it just trees? Is it buildings?


I'll throw in for it. I'll throw in 25 gold.


All right, let's get the fuck out of here!


Well, he reads thoughts but he gets them backwards, sometimes.


The explosive barrel that certainly won't explode.


Oh, God! Shit! (all laugh)


We already all got tattoos, didn't we?


Charisma...


(punching sounds)


It's the booze talking.


Natural 20!


Darkvision. Do I see anything?


As I see Keg bash it in a little bit of its insect armor, I take my staff and I get up under its exoskeleton and I start prying it off and I punch it to death.


That felt great.


Morning traffic Percy's like (groaning).


We're all real good friends.


(laughter) I'm a really good liar, Beau.


Okay, this is starting to paint a picture. You feel better now?


You can call him Percy.


I poke her more! (all laugh)


That's me! What do you need?


Yeah, we've got to get out of here.


A big statue just fell.


Did you know anyone who went?


Kaitiaki. I am honored to be in your presence.


(snorts) Give her 35 minutes.


Maybe it's a petting zoo.


He's blue as well, and he's always sweaty. Dark hair.


That's as far as it goes?


I can see the--


Oh, on him? Can I cast Hunter's Mark on him really quick?


I'm not saying that.


It's only for a few hours. Don't worry about it.


But the memory thing is crucial.


This is just like that scene in Tusk Love.


Can we be on the beach?


--look for traps? Can I just look for traps around the fountain without touching the water?


I don't trust Gil right now. I'm not going to trust Gil. I'm going to go with cobalt die. Natural 18.


How large are these lodestones that we're looking for?


I think this is the place.


I'm doing my best seeing from where I can see here. Keyleth is right in front of me?


I open the door, scratching my arm.


I wish my dad gave half as much effort as you have this year. Or I used to. Anyway, you know, we've missed you. Everybody has.


Then I guess I can take one of you on the broom with me.


Guys, I'm gonna make a Tor Books run, does anybody want anything?


That's all I've got, I think. That's it.


So 14.


That's a nine, plus two for 11.


I'm going to use one of my re-reroll a saving throw.


One could not infer that the new chosen was part of the newcomers from the way she wrote it or no? Is it separated thoughts?


I'm picturing a big yellow thing with little legs.


Nah, not a lot to report.


I'll have someone send a message.


"Bring him," so you won't be accompanying us on any adventure, or...?


Typically Scanlan is the oldest, but I've been aged the most maybe.


Has not changed.


Good to know. But the orb went through it?


Because I didn't make it in today!


I'm going to compare it to mine a little bit.


I'm going to try to cast Telekinesis, and (whoosh).


Math, everybody!


Can I, because you held your action. Can I get up there and give him the cheerleader, like the figure skater, Go, Grog! And see if I can do the, you know?


I can go. Going to the window. Anyone stopping me?


No, I don't, no. Just give us a quick stipend. Give us each 1,500 and let's move on.


I'm right there, yeah.


I don't. (laughter)


Tip your waiters.


We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's stay on task. Let's head to the Gilded Willows where in the Tri-Spire, where the fucking Scottsdale party-- What do these notes say, Skyskate Park and Constellation Boulevard.


I think I might have used up its only charge, potentially. Or it's recharging.


Yeah, maybe it'll open something.


It's ten by ten. I mean, encircled--


Do you want your hand?


Go ahead, Doty, speak.


And I multiclassed today, so I'm a rogue, so I get Sneak Attack on this.


Whatever Mama wants, Mama gets.


Little chibi Leatherface!


Oh, by the way, I can create a holocaust? Is that what you're doing? (laughter)


I don't know her name either. We might not have known a name.


Sons of bitches.


I mean there might be more survivors.


So guys. I'm thinking we take a local tour of all the historical highlights of Emon. We've never really gone sightseeing, Then maybe we can catch a nice dinner in the city tonight.


Is that what you needed all the d8s for?


Same day.


Are there any feathers?


You dropped a grenade, man. (laughing)


Keyleth, I saw something strange down there. I told everyone before, but I just don't know what it is, and I'm not quite sure how to go about finding out what's inside there. There's no plant life whatsoever, and you have a connection, do you not, to plants, to trees? A much stronger one than I certainly do, I would imagine.


Did you see season two of Prison Break? Because that's what we're doing.


We're actually here for a spot of work.


Oh, well I'm glad. I'm partial to it myself.


He starts sinking into the pool of lava?


Oh, hi there! Just here for a visit. Taryon Darrington. You haven't heard of me yet, but you will. Do you work here? Are you one of our employees?


Can we tell what they are? Now that we're closer?


Okay, so the one that was near Nott is three and seven for that one.


Things can hurt really bad and not do that much damage.


I want you to have a little more. There's no reason to hold back. Why?


Okay, I'm going to take the major bottle of acid, and I'm just going to--


I think he's a maybe.


But I was just handed this.


Thanks, Grog.


That's seven radiant damage.


Hasted, can I attempt to leap from this island to the one that Vax is currently on?


Wait! Who's climbing where?


We did pay on the way in. I did pay for a few days when we got in. I guess that is probably enough.


I heard there were some very good tropical fruits, super rare, in this crate. Based on what I found, (clicks). Good meal later on.


No, I'm going to knock on my sister's door before she falls asleep.


You're very gracious.


Should we get close to a port or something?


We're not on the boat, we're in sand.


Oh shit! Was it loud enough that anyone else could hear?


Wait, how many Greypsines are there?


But first you have to take your fire damage.


Does the dog need to make a dex save?


You can never die.


Umber hulk?


My eyes!


Okay, so I've got enough room to run up to its anus, which I'll do.


So, using one of the opals from my Helm of whatever, Brilliance, he wanted to craft a housing for it--


I look in.


No business back there!


Are you guys going in?


And they’re mainly gnomes working this--


No, we're going to put him back up.


You had mentioned briefly that some of Avantika's men and helpers had been armed with firearms. If I scout around, is there any ammo aboard this ship?


The things you do for women.


17, man!


Dude. Yes. Give it up for the fucking bard. Who has an article in Dear Vox Machina.


I'm going to do it at 4th because I have a couple of 4th-level left.


I got what you were saying, Grog.


And just because nothing else seems to be happening, I'm just gonna burn my Action Surge and just keep plowing into him for two more shots.


Yeah, they are.


You have one setting. Naughty.


She got shocked so hard we saw parts of her dream. (laughter)


Dexterity saving throw, you said? As my eagle form, right? 12?


Wouldn't you feel better if we had someone just keeping an eye on them? Bit explosive, the two of them together.


Are we gonna do the airship, or-- no, I guess we left the airship in Whitestone.


(growls) I go into a frenzied rage and I use reckless attack, along with my great weapon master, and I turn that thing into a piece of goo with my war hammer. (laughter)


We'll get her. She'll be fine!


You know, when you can't fall asleep--


Like, with advantage? I'm just having fun.


Yeah, and I go down as just backup.


Unfortunately, the last person to go on the Aramente didn't come back, which happens sometimes. Yeah.


I do hate to have my own words used against me.


We'll take a breath in the--


What do you have that you want to identify?


That thing's alive. That is definitely alive.


What if we stay hidden?


I want to see her intentions.


Are you guys going to arm wrestle?


I'm making the tiny hut, but I don't know how much time has passed while I was peeing.


He's missing.


I'm saying, I've just been waiting for them anyway. I'm going to stay.


We have Emerald City Comic Con, me and Travis.


Wait, wait, can you see me? There it is! So we had the aprons made, which we're so excited about. I didn't do it, Ben did it, and he's amazing. Ben did this! He made cupcakes with the Slayer's Cake logo for us for the 100th episode. We can eat them! So I'm passing them around.


Make him sound real brave, you know. Paint a good picture when you talk to her.


Daxio really needed a restart anyway. We can plan our attack from somewhere else.


I'm Marisha Ray.


(shouting) If you're not going to help stand out of my way!


So I will cast the spell, I'll sit down and start humming. (singing) My house is a very, very, very fine house. With chickens everywhere. It used to be so fair--


Like a cat in a tree, just - (beckoning whistle)


I just put down four gold pieces.


Only because of the dice, not because of your choices.


You can mix them. She knew I had a lot of white already on me, so I can make lots of colors.


And the ziggurat is above us?


Can we look, can we see? Can we see into the swamp?


Yeah, I'll go grab it and give it to Caleb.


Strength saving throw. Sorry, strength saving throw against 18.


Big five.


What's going on around here?


All right, all right, all right! Finally getting my money's worth.


Is there a snowstorm?


Nope. It's okay. I'm going to take a-- what do I have in here? It just says I have a healing potion. God, I don't know what that means.


I don't like the look of this thing. I'm going to turn invisible and I'm going to back up a little into the...


I think so too. Allura, will you say that Velora is safe, and that I'll be paying a visit very soon to return her?


You never know. He might just start doing a headstand. (laughter)


I don't know if I'm in his cone or not.


Is he at the hospital?


I stand at the top of the temple, and I wait to see them go out of range.


You can make shit, though, what can you make?


Can we ask, why would it bring retaliation? How would they know it was us?


When we were last there, hadn't they talked about a brass or bronze dragon? But there are brass dragons, as you well know.


Did we see which door the last two monsters came out of?


Why would I get that here? Is he up against anybody?


What do you mean, some beast? Who'd make a drink out of some animal's whatever?


Are we all going to get along for a couple of weeks?


Well look, I mean, Jester gets visited by the Traveler.


I invite her in.


30 minus five. 25. 10, 24, 26, 36.


I'd like a copy, if you don't mind.


Thank you all.


I realise this sounds very uncool when I say it out loud.


Can I ask one question first? Will you be pleasuring yourself during this?


Where do we sign up for the Victory Pit?


I'm going to send my insects further down after them.


Say it again. CritRole.


Let me take a moment. (laughter)


I don't understand anything you just said.


Not even wait a while. We'll go in.


Two trips, wait what? Why?


Hi, I'm Caleb.


Oh, I have the node.


Volunteer to be a tutor for 826.


And that's the first one, called shot.


Don't do this to yourself.


Stepping behind, I take my knife, and I cut his belt loose and let his pants fall, and I give him a little nudge.


I rolled a nine, so it doesn't even matter.


No. My rolls are too high; you really don't notice. (laughter)


Four to the right?


You know, if the monks beat you up to make them join your gang, they're not really your friends.


Then I would have (inhaling). Then I failed the lock picking.


We'll make t-shirts that say Team Vorugal.


I'm going to take the hide he had covering his junk, and wrap it around the heart, because obviously it can take being splattered by venom.


So you did a little peeping tom?


That's where the fish people live! Are there fish scales on the ground?


Hey man, you let strength be the dump stat.


Watch and learn from my hand symbols. What do you think of that, big guy?


Oh yeah, 23.


Mind Fire!


The Quick and the Dead.


We are. Yep-eb-eb. I'm tapped spell-wise.


I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself, and I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hex on the wolf that's nearest to Yasha and give it disadvantage on dexterity checks. I'm going to use my movement to run towards that wolf.


Our lot is hidden in the trees, a ways away?


It's so bad-good. I cannot wait.


Nice job, Matt!


I have so much murder in my eye right now.


Several dead people.


It's weighted.


Okay, and then we go home and the dragons are at war. Then what?


"Oh, same thing that kills us all around here. Dust poisoning. As we all know the Dust Bowl's full of radioactive dust. It melts your face clean off of the bone."


I'm going to start dashing to that next-- yeah, that direction.


There's nothing in that book that says he can't! There's something in this book that says something much worse.


That's badass!


Sure, yeah. Do you want to teleport it in the bag?


Go to the outcropping.


Percival. Coin.


To the right, stage right when I get out?


Hey, that's great, all right, let's get outta here then.


Yes. You're still very pretty.


Do we want to practice now and eat later, or eat now and practice later?


So I'm going to need those boots back.


Does he have an aversion to wearing pants?


Because it's free to stay there.


Anybody who tries to buy me a drink, I slip a silver into their pocket. Let me know how low we get.


I do, too!


Bring a lot of money with you for that vacation, did you?


Nope. No luck.


Just wait 'til we get there.


Oh, Grog, come on.


A lot? I know it does, it just told me to kill something.


Ornna, Ornna.


How was that for you? (all laugh)


I shall return soon.


Oh yeah, you want to mock until you realize you get your hit points!


Where are the little pissant guys?


Ah! Turn Undead. (laughter)


Go see if you can walk through the mirror.


Looking up! Things are looking up. He has 12 hit points, by the way.


Thank you. They're lovely.


What did we talk about grumpy people?


J'mon's symbol to show to all friends.


Yes. Well, you also got me back, and actually, it wasn't Percival, it was my brother who did it. Stole your armor?


Don't fall on me!


Weeks ago. Not five minutes ago.


You're going to be my strongest acolyte. You're going to preach the words of the water.


Or if they're like, "I'm going to climb up and check this out, Frank," and then they're like, "Frank!"


You didn't get taken from Alfield?


Can I take a piece of rock and toss it up?


I rolled a 19, and my initiative is 11.


Yeah, if a big, blue finger comes through the hole, we'll know Twiggy lied.


Kima is now an associate member of Vox Machina.


It's nothing personal.


Did you see Lady Kima?


-- run into the chasm is a bad idea.


I thought the guy told us we'd have to figure it out. Did he whisper anything to you?


Oh, yeah. Would I know that or would I not know that?


This is a pretty good plan. Then we can use that money to bribe The Gentleman to go back and woo my mama again.


Percy, what do you think?


What do I do? Max! (computer whistles)


We'll have to block it up behind us.


These are lizard people? Or these are snake people?


I would also like to point out that the definition of 'research', in this instance, is just reading the notes that I took last week, reading and doing actual research.


Dex, huh?


(in Chicago accent) Hey there, Grabowskis. Everybody from Wrigleyville to Lincoln Park is talking about the D&D Beyond. Whether you're checking out the Bean, riding the Red Line, or getting a pop at a Blackhawks game, you're always thinking about the Dungeons and the Dragons, and right now, if you enable content sharing on the D&D Beyond and one of your pals has a Master Tier subscription, your whole campaign crew can share all the materials and the content, not just the DM. Anybody with a Master subscription can do it, so jump on the "L," take the Eisenhower to the Kennedy, throw back a PBR or a 312 and grab a deep dish on me, because life just got a little better with the D&D Beyond. Oh, and don't forget to call dibs on the Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, out next month. Pre-order yours on the D&D Beyond site and get all kinds of exclusive stuff and junk. Go Bears!


Let's see if it's a natural 20. It is not a natural 20. Then, okay, hang on, I used my bonus action. Oh, I get one more hit.


Yeah, but we took a short break and we're not doing that now.


I don't think it was her. She's been nice.


Wait, what is this one?


At disadvantage? 16 doesn't hit.


I try as fast as I can-- wait, from who?


It's something I've always been able to-- why is everybody looking at me like-- (vomiting sound)
