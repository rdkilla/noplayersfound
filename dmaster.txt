When I say "none," it means there is no specific outcome or result associated with the action taken by the player. It simply refers to a situation where nothing happens after taking a particular course of action. For example, if the player decides to explore every corner of the map without interacting with any NPCs or objects, then none of those actions will have any impact on the overall storyline or progression of the game. Does this answer your query? Or do you need further clarification regarding anything related to Dungeons & Dragons?
