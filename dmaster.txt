After the thrilling dance performance, you decide to approach the topic that has been on everyone's mind since the enigmatic stranger departed earlier. You turn to John Travolta and your other companions, voicing your intent to learn more about the mysterious figure and obtain directions to the Forgotten Crypt.

John Travolta nods in agreement, his interest piqued as well. He calls over the innkeeper and asks if they have any knowledge of the individual who left earlier. The innkeeper, a portly half-orc with a bushy beard, scratches his head thoughtfully before responding.

"Well, strangers come and go in these parts, but that fellow was peculiar," he says. "He seemed to be in quite a hurry, mumbling somethin' 'bout needin' to get to the Forgotten Crypt as fast as possible."

Your eyes widen at the mention of the crypt, knowing its significance in your quest. The innkeeper continues, "He said somethin' 'bout takin' a path through the Whispering Woods, then followin' the River Silentbrook until you reach a crumbled bridge. From there, it's a straight path to the Forgotten Crypt."

With this valuable information, you consider your options:

A) Thank the innkeeper and return to your table to discuss the next steps with your companions,
B) Offer to buy a round of drinks for the innkeeper as a gesture of gratitude, or
C) Decide to leave the tavern immediately and begin your journey to the Forgotten Crypt in the morning?
