As the words leave your lips, you focus your arcane energy and channel the powerful spell of Disco Fury. With a dramatic flourish, a brown, orange, and yellow smoke cloud appears at your fingertips. The smoky haze billows out, engulfing the entire tavern in a kaleidoscope of colors.

As the smoke begins to clear, the patrons gasp in amazement as John Travolta materializes right in front of you, dressed in his iconic Saturday Night Fever suit. The legendary actor looks around, slightly disoriented, but a smile slowly spreads across his face as he realizes the incredible situation he's found himself in.

A) Lead the crowd in a wild dance routine, showing off your own impressive moves and encouraging everyone to join in,
